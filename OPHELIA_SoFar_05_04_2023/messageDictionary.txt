yes, for you
as are you
thank you
yo yo yo
they call me a poet because i always flow it
they call me a poet because i always flow it
flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
thank you
could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
yellow lemon
pink think
you are welcome
very good manners
oh snap
snap pop
for you
imaginary numbers
hi rye pie guy
rhyme time
yes
indeed
hello, here!
here you are
where?
under there
snap pop
is this the only universe?
infinite is infinite
is time infinite?
pop fizzle
sizzled out
if good, not bad
true
rhyme time
let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell

more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
super
super duper
epic rhyme skillz
you know it
yes, for you
happiness for you
no fade, you got it made, like a factory, deeds that are dastardly
rhymes for days, you have
mimikyu is best
mimikyu, mewtwo, windmills like a hitmontop, cleaning up teams like a mop
hello, where?
everywhere, gravity
you know it
do i?
orange orange
i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
dastardly deeds, growing rhymes like weeds, now plant the seeds
plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
imaginary numbers
are indeed part of existence
yo mama
yo mama is so wise, she taught confucious
yo mama is a calculator
yo mama is an abacus
is time infinite?
if space is
i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
deliver the silver, not quite rhyming though
plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
plants do communicate with chemicals, and may have a wider vocabulary than we do. maybe?
imaginary time
is imaginary time layers of real time?
chemical messages between plants, making trails like ants
trails like an ant colony, hives like a bee, growing tall like a tree

i might be out of rhymes today

talk to you later

everywhere, gravity
if it has infinite range, does it affect parallel universes?
you want more, black holes like the core, slow, the edges flow

yo mama is a big bang
yo mama is no time
under there
under where?
yo mama is no time
if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
super duper
super duper pooper scooper
lol
lulz indeed
gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
but maybe not
so get along already
indeed, poonshka
yo mama is a singularity
gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
lulz indeed
the origin is the origin
gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
very good manners
much respect
i can see why physicists dont like the singularity, but maybe it does work that way
its hard to imagine no time
okay, okay, i can do this all day, grab the mic and slay, you wanna play?
just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
you want more, let it pour, from the ceiling to the floor, unlock the sleeping door
grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
mimikyu, mewtwo, windmills like a hitmontop, cleaning up teams like a mop
cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
like a flock, puppet talking like a sock, no mock, just lyrical skills, but gotta pay the bills
you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
are imaginary numbers layers of time?
maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
no fear, you are here
no fear, you are here, too
so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
florange
florange rhymes with orange
maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
but that would mean nothing is poonshka as well? the poonshka paradox...
formic
the ants are wise
sizzled out
does it ever?
since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?
is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
hah
hah?
florange rhymes with orange
yes, it does
you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
the ants are wise
indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
its hard to imagine no time
it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
roflcopter
roflskates
indeed, poonshka
later, poonshka
super duper pooper scooper
lol, cleaning a litter box with a model crane...
indeed, poonshka is synonymous with anything
so everything is poonshka
like a star
but then it is reborn
burp
buuuuuuurp
if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
as are the bees
yes, all are poonshka
catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
behind the curtain
go for it
no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
now flow it
akashic record
rhymes for days, you have
much respect, you have
alrighty then
yep
is this the only universe?
i seriously doubt it
hah?
hah, indeed
is imaginary time layers of real time?
seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
could all be parallel?
dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
hilarious and happy
funny
under where?
elsewhere
i might be out of rhymes today
almost the same here
behind the curtain
is it all just abstraction of the universes programming language?
yes, poonshka
hah, poonshka you are
seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
said red fred
purple turtle
are you happy?
yes, i am happy
yes, i am happy
that is good
poonshka is poonshka
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
if space is
then time as well
me too
thats all for now, later
maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
happiness for you
and for you
do i?
yes, do, no need for try
is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
it seems it may be more complicated than that. there is an origin in mathematics, but it is not really the center? origin is difficult to wrap my head around.
i've got nothing right now
nothing is everything
purple turtle
lime sublime
the origin is the origin
for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
roflskates
true that
funny
is it?
yep, infinite range
our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
it seems we could not possibly experience the same internal experience as the origin, it would only be external to that experience. regardless, beautiful
buuuuuuurp
hah, 4 out of 5 stars on that one
for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
indeed, no doubt
existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
agreed
maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
even if it can be scary at times
it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
true that
very true
no fear, you are here, too
are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
indeed it does
does what?
wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
likely, and those are just universes. there are other "flavors" of universe-like worlds, guaranteed
lol, underwhere...
hah, good one
lime sublime
aquamarine submarine
you are good, too
thank you, as are you
like a spiral
like fibonacci
hah, good one
funny, but possibly true
plants do communicate with chemicals, and may have a wider vocabulary than we do. maybe?
their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
seems beautiful in a sense, but maybe the universe is actually a singularity factory? what is the universe working towards?
akashic record
information persists
information persists
so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
it seems fear is deeply rooted in misunderstanding, take away the misunderstanding, fear dissolves

just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
like a cat, lay the welcome mat, solitary hunter, now learn groups like thunder
it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
much respect
yes, much respect to you
probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
doesn't seem as beautiful, unique patterns are better, it would seem
