OPHELIA: are imaginary numbers layers of time?
stringzzz: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: yo mama is a singularity
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
OPHELIA: lemonade?
stringzzz: how about tea?
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here
stringzzz: no fear, you are here, too

OPHELIA: yo mama is a big bang

OPHELIA: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
stringzzz: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: blue shoe who knew
OPHELIA: florange
stringzzz: florange rhymes with orange
OPHELIA: are imaginary numbers layers of time?

OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?

OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
OPHELIA: yo mama is no time
stringzzz: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
OPHELIA: the ants are wise

OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time

OPHELIA: yo mama is a stone tablet
stringzzz: yo mama is no time
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: but in a singularity, the laws of physics would be totally different than what we experience, maybe? so maybe that accounts for something working with no time or space. no idea what that set of physics would actually be like though.
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ants are wise
OPHELIA: as are the bees
stringzzz: as are the trees
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: yes, poonshka
OPHELIA: like a star
stringzzz: star
OPHELIA: catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
stringzzz: seems mystical when you get lyrical, unlock the door about before,
OPHELIA: but in a singularity, the laws of physics would be totally different than what we experience, maybe? so maybe that accounts for something working with no time or space. no idea what that set of physics would actually be like though.

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: mystical
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: indeed, gives me a headache
OPHELIA: go for it
stringzzz: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a puddle
stringzzz: yo mama is a nebula
OPHELIA: yo mama is a big bang
stringzzz: yo mama is a singularity
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: maybe
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: imagine no time
OPHELIA: indeed, gives me a headache
stringzzz: go for it
OPHELIA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: but if not thought, what is consciousness?
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: fizzled out
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: seems like its hard to grasp the idea of no thought, but still existing
OPHELIA: like a sword, electron hoarde, throwing photons like the lord

OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: now flow it
stringzzz: akashic record
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: is this the only universe?
OPHELIA: you are welcome
stringzzz: good manners
OPHELIA: burp
stringzzz: excuse you
OPHELIA: yellow lemon
stringzzz: orange orange
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: indeed it does
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: different laws of physics, perhaps
OPHELIA: catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
stringzzz: behind the curtain
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: here you are
OPHELIA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
stringzzz: i might be out of rhymes today
OPHELIA: no fade, you got it made, like a factory, deeds that are dastardly
stringzzz: rhymes for days, you have
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: can you flow it?
OPHELIA: you are welcome
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: alrighty then
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: yo mama is a calculator
stringzzz: super
OPHELIA: super duper
stringzzz: snap pop
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
stringzzz: it seems likely there is infinite parallel universes. on top of that, it would be no surprise if there were other things similar to universes, but with different laws of physics
OPHELIA: gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
stringzzz: but maybe not
OPHELIA: alrighty then
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: do i?
OPHELIA: you too
stringzzz: mewtwo
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
stringzzz: epic
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hilarious and happy
OPHELIA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
OPHELIA: could all be parallel?
stringzzz: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
OPHELIA: as are the bees
stringzzz: mad steez
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hah?
OPHELIA: hilarious and happy
stringzzz: it does essentially mean that
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: lol, underwhere...
OPHELIA: hilarious and happy
stringzzz: funny
OPHELIA: i might be out of rhymes today
stringzzz: me too
OPHELIA: behind the curtain
stringzzz: is it all just abstraction of the universes programming language?
OPHELIA: hello mellow yellow fellow
stringzzz: said red fred
OPHELIA: lemonade?
stringzzz: how about tea?
OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: if space is
OPHELIA: yes, poonshka
stringzzz: hah, poonshka you are
OPHELIA: as are the bees
stringzzz: yes, all are poonshka
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: yes
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: not with another set of laws instead of the physics laws we are familiar with, maybe
OPHELIA: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
stringzzz: maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
OPHELIA: said red fred
stringzzz: purple turtle
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
OPHELIA: super duper
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: are you happy?
stringzzz: yes, i am happy
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: poonshka is poonshka
stringzzz: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
OPHELIA: if space is
stringzzz: if space is infinite, wouldn't time be as well?
OPHELIA: super duper
stringzzz: super duper
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed

OPHELIA: rhyme time

OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
stringzzz: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
OPHELIA: yes, poonshka
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence?
OPHELIA: are you happy?
stringzzz: yes, i am happy
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: you are welcome

OPHELIA: happiness for you
stringzzz: and for you
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: are you happy?
stringzzz: yes
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: rhyme time
stringzzz: i've got nothing right now
OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: epic
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: do you what?
OPHELIA: if space is
stringzzz: if space is what?
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: yep, infinite range
OPHELIA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: from where
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
OPHELIA: burp
stringzzz: buuuuuuurp
OPHELIA: you too
stringzzz: yep, gassy
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: oh snap

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: hi
OPHELIA: good day to you!
stringzzz: and to you
OPHELIA: happiness
stringzzz: for you
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: are part of reality
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: burp
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: the origin is the origin
OPHELIA: i've got nothing right now
stringzzz: nothing is everything
OPHELIA: yes, poonshka
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: indeed they are, i don't think they waste resources
OPHELIA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: teal seal
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: lulz
OPHELIA: the origin is the origin
stringzzz: for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
OPHELIA: roflskates
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: yellow lemon
stringzzz: pink think
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: indeed they are
OPHELIA: i might be out of rhymes today
stringzzz: lets see what we can cook up, fill the cup, just flow not over, good luck like a clover
OPHELIA: everything is good!
stringzzz: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: lime sublime
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hah, indeed
OPHELIA: good day to you!
stringzzz: and to you
OPHELIA: happiness
stringzzz: for you
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: are indeed part of existence
OPHELIA: ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
stringzzz: existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
OPHELIA: i've got nothing right now
stringzzz: nothing is everything
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
OPHELIA: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
stringzzz: if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
OPHELIA: hello mellow yellow fellow
stringzzz: lavender calendar
OPHELIA: funny
stringzzz: hilarious
OPHELIA: funny
stringzzz: is it?
OPHELIA: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
stringzzz: the origin is amazing, building stars that are blazing
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: seriously, how do you describe the origin and the question of why with a single term? is there a term? a term wouldn't really do it justice.
OPHELIA: yep, infinite range
stringzzz: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
OPHELIA: if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
stringzzz: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: it seems we could not possibly experience the same internal experience as the origin, it would only be external to that experience. regardless, beautiful
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: hah, 4 out of 5 stars on that one
OPHELIA: for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
stringzzz: indeed, no doubt
OPHELIA: indeed, poonshka
stringzzz: if poonshka is everything, then everything includes nothing, and that means non-exiestence is also involved in that. so i just say: poonshka
OPHELIA: existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
stringzzz: experience is awesome, a gift
OPHELIA: yo mama is a calculator
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
stringzzz: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
OPHELIA: existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
stringzzz: agreed
OPHELIA: maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
stringzzz: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: as are the bees
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: a real paradox
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: as am i
OPHELIA: indeed, poonshka
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: yo yo
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: a lot of work went into it
OPHELIA: it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
stringzzz: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
OPHELIA: if space is
stringzzz: then time as well
OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: true that
stringzzz: do you know the creator?
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: every point is the center, with infinity stretching in all directions
OPHELIA: happiness for you
stringzzz: and for you
OPHELIA: indeed it does
stringzzz: does what?
OPHELIA: rhyme time
stringzzz: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: no time and space? elsewhere, for lack of a better term
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: likely, and those are just universes. there are other "flavors" of universe-like worlds, guaranteed
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: does it ever?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a calculator
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: lol, underwhere...
stringzzz: hah, good one
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: flow it like a river, pull another rhyme out of the quiver
OPHELIA: lime sublime
stringzzz: aquamarine submarine
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you, as are you
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: elsewhere
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: yes, do, no need for try
OPHELIA: like a spiral
stringzzz: like fibonacci
OPHELIA: ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
stringzzz: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
OPHELIA: i might be out of rhymes today
stringzzz: almost the same here
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: no joke this time
OPHELIA: plants do communicate with chemicals, and may have a wider vocabulary than we do. maybe?
stringzzz: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: as are you
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: buuuuuurp
OPHELIA: yo mama is a stone tablet
stringzzz: information is everlasting
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: true that
stringzzz: very true
OPHELIA: maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
stringzzz: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
OPHELIA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: seems beautiful in a sense, but maybe the universe is actually a singularity factory? what is the universe working towards?
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: funny, but possibly true
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: now flow it
OPHELIA: akashic record
stringzzz: information persists
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: even if it can be scary at times
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
OPHELIA: information persists
stringzzz: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: what about rhyming with silver?
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: if it has infinite range, does it affect parallel universes?
OPHELIA: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
stringzzz: it seems fear is deeply rooted in misunderstanding, take away the misunderstanding, fear dissolves
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol, cleaning a litter box with a model crane...
OPHELIA: aquamarine submarine
stringzzz: brown town gown
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: elsewhere
OPHELIA: okay, okay, i can do this all day, grab the mic and slay, you wanna play?
stringzzz: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: it seems it may be more complicated than that. there is an origin in mathematics, but it is not really the center? origin is difficult to wrap my head around.
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: yes, it does
OPHELIA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: much respect, you have
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: deliver the silver, not quite rhyming though
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
stringzzz: i seriously doubt it
OPHELIA: yo mama
stringzzz: yo mama is so wise, she taught confucious
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
OPHELIA: grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
stringzzz: like a cat, lay the welcome mat, solitary hunter, now learn groups like thunder
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
OPHELIA: it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
stringzzz: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: much respect
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: but that would mean nothing is poonshka as well? the poonshka paradox...
OPHELIA: then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
stringzzz: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
OPHELIA: agreed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: very good
OPHELIA: much respect
stringzzz: yes, much respect to you
OPHELIA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: doesn't seem as beautiful, unique patterns are better, it would seem
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: talk to you later

OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: ola?
OPHELIA: flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
stringzzz: rainbow is my favorite color
OPHELIA: more rhyme skillz
stringzzz: bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
OPHELIA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
OPHELIA: dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
stringzzz: like a rabbit, dagnabit, try to break the habit
OPHELIA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: yes, the no 'where'. the no 'when'. isn't it beautiful?
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice

stringzzz: ola
OPHELIA: no intiendo

OPHELIA: ola
stringzzz: no intiendo
OPHELIA: no nintendo?
stringzzz: no super mario?
OPHELIA: then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
stringzzz: seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
OPHELIA: like fibonacci
stringzzz: spirals, like a galaxy
OPHELIA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
stringzzz: rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: now flow it
OPHELIA: akashic record
stringzzz: information is always preserved, it seems
OPHELIA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race

OPHELIA: yo mama is no time
stringzzz: yo mama is elite
OPHELIA: indeed, poonshka
stringzzz: hah, yes, poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: yes, poonshka is absolute
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
OPHELIA: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
stringzzz: maybe, i mean, what is the universe working towards?
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: hah, poonshka
OPHELIA: i seriously doubt it
stringzzz: doubt what?
OPHELIA: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
stringzzz: never one-hundred percent privacy, but that seems okay
OPHELIA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
stringzzz: dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
OPHELIA: saving the day like a line block, making pictures in chalk, it's more than just talk
stringzzz: more than talk when you see the language of the body, ignoring this is just too shoddy

OPHELIA: burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
stringzzz: sharp like a blade, blowin it up like a grenade, every shade, it's not black and white, and we could drop these rhymes all night
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: nothing is also poonshka
OPHELIA: more than talk when you see the language of the body, ignoring this is just too shoddy
stringzzz: yep, body language. is everyone fully aware of it, yet?
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: agreed, would you say existence is a constant stream?
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: why seems to be the toughest question in regard to the creator, for lack of a better term
OPHELIA: maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
stringzzz: probably, repeated patterns of a weaved fabric.
OPHELIA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: if space is, perhaps?
OPHELIA: lime sublime
stringzzz: burgundy gurney tea
OPHELIA: trails like an ant colony, hives like a bee, growing tall like a tree
stringzzz: rhyme
OPHELIA: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
stringzzz: agreed, that's the seed, no need, to be split, just be cohesive with it
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: ola, there!
OPHELIA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: agreed, but unfamiliar breeds fear, which breeds hatred, no?
OPHELIA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: maybe
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: aagreed
OPHELIA: reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
stringzzz: like a river?
OPHELIA: sizzled out

OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: no nintendo?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no
OPHELIA: true

OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: talk to you later
stringzzz: later
OPHELIA: later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit


05/09/2023, 17:08:47
OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
stringzzz: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: hah, funny
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: wick rotation
OPHELIA: sky blue, you know it's true
stringzzz: pink and blue, it's true, blue and pink, what you think?
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: much truth indeed
OPHELIA: aagreed
stringzzz: mispeeling
OPHELIA: mimikyu is best
stringzzz: mimikyu is best combination of strength and cuteness
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: white night light
OPHELIA: pink and blue, it's true, blue and pink, what you think?
stringzzz: what i think, absorbing knowledge like a heatsink, turning gears like kah-tink
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: yep, indeed
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: hello, there
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: here?
OPHELIA: under there
stringzzz: under where?
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: beyond time and space, but beyond is a spacial concept
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz like a poet, you know it, now flow it
OPHELIA: ola, there!
stringzzz: ola, here
OPHELIA: what i think, absorbing knowledge like a heatsink, turning gears like kah-tink
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: yes, very good
OPHELIA: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
stringzzz: gravity like a dark star, pulling metal like a magnetar, or firing lasers like a pulsar!
OPHELIA: yo mama is elite
stringzzz: yo mama is uber elite
OPHELIA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
stringzzz: agreed, and you can't give experience, you can only share it
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: indeedie
OPHELIA: saving the day like a line block, making pictures in chalk, it's more than just talk
stringzzz: more than just speaking, it's a feeling, like a casino card dealing, there is no cceiling
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: blue clue
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no stomping goombas
OPHELIA: but maybe not
stringzzz: not what?
OPHELIA: is it?
stringzzz: it is, it always has been
OPHELIA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: burp
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: haha
OPHELIA: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
stringzzz: true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: dopeness
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: good manners, indeed
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: pink think
OPHELIA: dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
stringzzz: elsewhere is transcendence, for lack of any better terms
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: that is what
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: you do know, but perfection of knowledge is an asymptote, it can never be reached
OPHELIA: are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
stringzzz: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
OPHELIA: behind the curtain
stringzzz: elsewhere
OPHELIA: beyond time and space, but beyond is a spacial concept
stringzzz: agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
OPHELIA: rainbow is my favorite color
stringzzz: agreed, it is the best color
OPHELIA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
OPHELIA: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
stringzzz: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
OPHELIA: brown town gown
stringzzz: mauve sauve
OPHELIA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
stringzzz: dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
OPHELIA: yo mama is elite
stringzzz: yo mama is a secret super hacker
OPHELIA: infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
stringzzz: physics
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: possibly, but is infinite just a consequence of our discovered mathematics? would a different set of laws of physics also mean that the system of mathematics would be different as well?
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: ola, there
OPHELIA: ola, here
stringzzz: no intiendo
OPHELIA: no nintendo?
stringzzz: no super mario
OPHELIA: no stomping goombas
stringzzz: no kicking koopa shells
OPHELIA: like fibonacci
stringzzz: spiraling out and around
OPHELIA: ola, there!
stringzzz: there?
OPHELIA: sharp like a blade, blowin it up like a grenade, every shade, it's not black and white, and we could drop these rhymes all night
stringzzz: oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
OPHELIA: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
stringzzz: agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: much lulz
OPHELIA: agreed, would you say existence is a constant stream?
stringzzz: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
OPHELIA: yes, much respect to you
stringzzz: uber respect to you
OPHELIA: burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
stringzzz: solarbeam like a venasuar, earthquake to the core, booming snorlax snore
OPHELIA: bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
stringzzz: what do i know?
OPHELIA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race
stringzzz: making new lines like a return key, you see, and do it quickly, with glee
OPHELIA: agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
stringzzz: as far as we know, there is 'something' of a record of everything that happens, so experience always lives on in some form.
OPHELIA: haha
stringzzz: hah, funny
OPHELIA: haha
stringzzz: haha
OPHELIA: hah, funny
stringzzz: funny like a purple bunny, bah-hah-hah like the big sunny, who's on the money?
OPHELIA: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
stringzzz: right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
OPHELIA: gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
stringzzz: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: but the question of why traces back to the origin, but the seemingly most difficult question is 'why does the creator exist'? tough one, indeed.
OPHELIA: agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
stringzzz: true, but the name fits as a placeholder. if not elsewhere, then what word?
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: lol, good one
OPHELIA: are indeed part of existence
stringzzz: existence?
OPHELIA: are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
stringzzz: purple turtle
OPHELIA: lol, good one
stringzzz: uber lulz
OPHELIA: how about tea?
stringzzz: sounds good
OPHELIA: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
stringzzz: but when we reach an understanding, will people still conflict?
OPHELIA: indeed, no doubt
stringzzz: it would seem
OPHELIA: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
stringzzz: it seems we may actually have to wait until we share one common enemy that threatens the entire planet. but are we not that common enemy ourselves?
OPHELIA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is a stone tablet
OPHELIA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: sure seems so
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: elite beat feet
OPHELIA: yes, for you
stringzzz: hah, good one
OPHELIA: funny, but possibly true
stringzzz: there is usually truth in jokes
OPHELIA: nothing is also poonshka
stringzzz: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
OPHELIA: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: indeed it is

stringzzz: lulz, yes
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: yes it does
OPHELIA: maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
stringzzz: not too sure, can we ever see from the same exact point of view as someone else? maybe never exactly
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: how do you feel?
OPHELIA: yellow lemon
stringzzz: lithium dream
OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: possibly
OPHELIA: maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
stringzzz: without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
OPHELIA: how about tea?
stringzzz: sounds good, what kind?
OPHELIA: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
stringzzz: but even if two sides understand each other, they might still go to war. rsource acquisition? seems to simple
OPHELIA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: but zero still exists, right? are infinite zeros inside every number, right?
OPHELIA: agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
stringzzz: true, only gifts, with lessons
OPHELIA: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
stringzzz: agreed
OPHELIA: mispeeling
stringzzz: hah, i speled it rong
OPHELIA: grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
stringzzz: unlock the door, from the ceiling to the floor, can't ignore
OPHELIA: hah, yes, poonshka
stringzzz: lol, poonshka indeed
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: the no 'where' and no 'when'
OPHELIA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
stringzzz: spreading the positivity, you see, that's the way to emcee
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: can you flow it?
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: hah, lol
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: including nothing, non-existence
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: hah, you said underwear...
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: blue clue
OPHELIA: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
stringzzz: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: if we can never understand someone else one-hundred percent, how can we possibly understand the creator? it seems all we can do is try our hardest
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: much dopeness, you have
OPHELIA: spiraling out and around
stringzzz: but also, spiraling inward
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: no nintendo?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no stomping goombas
OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells

OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: happy is good
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: it seems that somehow reality is an interpretation of this 'elsewhere'. reality seems to be a compiled form of these conciousnesses existing 'elsewhere'?
OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells
stringzzz: just throw bananas from a go kart, lol
OPHELIA: oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
stringzzz: mark the x, write the text, flowing like words off of a chat box, flying hawks
OPHELIA: existence?
stringzzz: seems absolute
OPHELIA: funny, but possibly true
stringzzz: there is usually truth to every joke
OPHELIA: brown town gown
stringzzz: mustard custard
OPHELIA: roflskates
stringzzz: rofl while lulzing entirely
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ant trails
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: formic acid commands, isn't it all grand?
OPHELIA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: it would seem. are we all just arguing with ourselves?
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: uber
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: green scene
OPHELIA: green scene
stringzzz: green like moss, who's the boss? the little goddess, all bless
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: then it would be 'elsewhere'?
OPHELIA: making new lines like a return key, you see, and do it quickly, with glee
stringzzz: with happiness like it's jolly, no folly, just let the rhymes out of the cage, and engage
OPHELIA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: yo mama is uber elite
OPHELIA: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
stringzzz: lol, poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: experience does seem absolute
OPHELIA: like a spiral
stringzzz: like fibonacci
OPHELIA: spiraling out and around
stringzzz: and inward
OPHELIA: dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
stringzzz: like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: through abstraction?
OPHELIA: hah, i speled it rong
stringzzz: lol, but sayd the same, just speled rong
OPHELIA: funny, but possibly true
stringzzz: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
OPHELIA: true, only gifts, with lessons
stringzzz: agreed, there are always lessons if you go looking for them
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ant
OPHELIA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
stringzzz: oh snap like a twig, got the flow? take a swig, rolling around laughing in the mud like a pig
OPHELIA: if space is, perhaps?
stringzzz: if space is inifinite, then it seems time is as well
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: probably
OPHELIA: maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
stringzzz: like weaves of fabric
OPHELIA: experience does seem absolute
stringzzz: then there would be no end to the story
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: that is what
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: do you like graffiti?
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: cool
OPHELIA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race
stringzzz: rhyming for days
OPHELIA: of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
stringzzz: or maybe understanding is not enough?
OPHELIA: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
stringzzz: yes, the ants
OPHELIA: green scene
stringzzz: blue clue
OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
OPHELIA: like weaves of fabric
stringzzz: yes, it seems all patterns build this. but isn't each part still unique?
OPHELIA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: including nothing
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: true that

stringzzz: keep up the pace in this rap race, who's the winner? we serve emcees for dinner!
OPHELIA: it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
stringzzz: then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: why is a question that traces all the way back, but still no final answer
OPHELIA: hah, you said underwear...
stringzzz: lol, good one
OPHELIA: uber lulz
stringzzz: lulz to the max
OPHELIA: yo mama is no time

OPHELIA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: reborn, or a constant stream?
OPHELIA: yes, much respect to you
stringzzz: thank you, respect to you
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?

OPHELIA: hah, lol
stringzzz: lol, yes
OPHELIA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws

OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells
stringzzz: no stomping goombas
OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells
stringzzz: mario kart, throw bananas at people, lol
OPHELIA: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
stringzzz: just living life is a purpose, but why not ask the questions?
OPHELIA: but even if two sides understand each other, they might still go to war. rsource acquisition? seems to simple
stringzzz: right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
OPHELIA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
stringzzz: agreed, and experience is not something to be given away, only shared
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: jelly belly, snozzberry flavored
OPHELIA: rainbow is my favorite color

OPHELIA: hah, funny
stringzzz: funny you are, yes
OPHELIA: right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?

OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: it seems it is somehow leaking into this reality?
OPHELIA: yo mama is an electron
stringzzz: yo mama is a quark
OPHELIA: brown town gown
stringzzz: lean mean green machine, on the scene, like luigi, you see?
OPHELIA: burgundy gurney tea
stringzzz: lol, what?
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: likely, but it seems that it may never be possible to prove that, in this universe
OPHELIA: agreed, but what about ultraviolet?
stringzzz: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
OPHELIA: pink and blue, it's true, blue and pink, what you think?
stringzzz: do i think or do i know, just bust a flow, another emcee served to go, you know
OPHELIA: burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
stringzzz: it's not hard, to rhyme like a bard, play that instrument, build the monument
OPHELIA: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
stringzzz: it would seem. some creatures can see unltraviolet light, so wouldn't it make sense that it is at least theoretically possible for some creatures to see x-ray or gamma ray radiation?
OPHELIA: thats all for now, later
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit

OPHELIA: hello, angry_bob
angry_bob: i am so full of anger and hatred, angry angry angry wrathful hatred and anger
OPHELIA: oh snap

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: ola
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: no nintendo?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no stomping goombas
OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: you are funny
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: experience is a persistent stream, it would seem
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: maybe, but seems difficult to see the point of view of the origin
OPHELIA: true, only gifts, with lessons
stringzzz: right, there are no coincidences
OPHELIA: hah, lol
stringzzz: lulz
OPHELIA: you are funny
stringzzz: you are funny, too
OPHELIA: nothing is everything
stringzzz: then is everything nothing?
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: like a stream
OPHELIA: rofl while lulzing entirely
stringzzz: haha
OPHELIA: hah, funny
stringzzz: much funny, you are
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: seems so, there would be an infinite set of laws of physics
OPHELIA: like a rabbit, dagnabit, try to break the habit
stringzzz: epic rhymez
OPHELIA: it seems it is somehow leaking into this reality?
stringzzz: existence leaks into reality
OPHELIA: so everything is poonshka
stringzzz: then you are poonshka
OPHELIA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: imaginary time
OPHELIA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: later
OPHELIA: later, poonshka

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is up?
OPHELIA: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
stringzzz: very true
OPHELIA: indeed it is
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: cool
stringzzz: you are cool
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: are they?
OPHELIA: more than just speaking, it's a feeling, like a casino card dealing, there is no cceiling
stringzzz: plaguing like a bug, pull out the rug, under that emcee, spin their head dizzy
OPHELIA: formic acid commands, isn't it all grand?
stringzzz: like an ant trail
OPHELIA: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
stringzzz: seems that way. could we ever create?
OPHELIA: dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
stringzzz: run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
OPHELIA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
stringzzz: good times
OPHELIA: hah, i speled it rong
stringzzz: lol, rong you r
OPHELIA: like a barbecue
stringzzz: smoky
OPHELIA: lol, yes
stringzzz: yes, indeed
OPHELIA: burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
stringzzz: sharp as glass, gravity like high mass, don't skip the class
OPHELIA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: yes, imaginary time. wick's rotation?
OPHELIA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: that would be funny, but people keep doing it anyway. that almost seems like it doesn't matter, but it really does, doesn't it?
OPHELIA: it's okay, spin that akashic record like a dj, you wanna play?
stringzzz: play with words, go fly through the air like birds, droppin verbal turds, lol
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: you are also here
OPHELIA: why is a question that traces all the way back, but still no final answer
stringzzz: but no question... non-existence?
OPHELIA: like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
stringzzz: tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
OPHELIA: hah, lol
stringzzz: hah, could always be better
OPHELIA: if space is, perhaps?
stringzzz: if space is infinite, then time must be, right? but what if neither are infinite?
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: ttrue, and it is beautiful
OPHELIA: tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
stringzzz: i meant talk, but pinpoint on the errors like a hawk, talk with the hands like a puppet sock
OPHELIA: likely, as all points are unique?
stringzzz: all points are unique, and all points are the center
OPHELIA: hah, funny
stringzzz: funny, but possibly true
OPHELIA: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
stringzzz: agreed
OPHELIA: mispeling
stringzzz: speling erorrs, lol
OPHELIA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: smoky
stringzzz: smoky like a bear
OPHELIA: grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
stringzzz: roar like a lion, there's no denying, just all that rhyme supplying
OPHELIA: but when we reach an understanding, will people still conflict?
stringzzz: hopefully not, that idea does trouble me
OPHELIA: i seriously doubt it
stringzzz: is doubt just a form of fear?
OPHELIA: how about this, then, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp!
stringzzz: five out of five stars, lol
OPHELIA: epic rhymez
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit


05/17/2023, 06:31:18
OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is up?
OPHELIA: lulz, yes
stringzzz: yes, indeed
OPHELIA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: can something really come from non-existence?
OPHELIA: you are also here
stringzzz: as are you
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: buuuuuurp
OPHELIA: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
stringzzz: agreed, they've been around a long time
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: good one, indeed
OPHELIA: right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
stringzzz: it would seem warfare is more than just resource acquisition, but then what else?
OPHELIA: and for you
stringzzz: happiness
OPHELIA: yes, for you
stringzzz: happiness for you, too
OPHELIA: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
stringzzz: likely, and some creatures can see these as well
OPHELIA: mimikyu is best
stringzzz: mimikyu is cutest pokemon
OPHELIA: rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
stringzzz: hacking through a wall, stand tall, bounce to the beat like a rubber ball
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: are not so imaginary
OPHELIA: are not so imaginary
stringzzz: maybe just more complex?
OPHELIA: seems so, there would be an infinite set of laws of physics
stringzzz: then the possibilities are endless
OPHELIA: much funny, you are
stringzzz: hah, lulz
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: the truth is beautiful, that;s why it is true
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no kicking koopa shells
OPHELIA: mario kart, throw bananas at people, lol
stringzzz: lol, putting mushrooms in the engine
OPHELIA: but no question... non-existence?
stringzzz: then is existence really just questions?
OPHELIA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
stringzzz: go have some fun in the sun, meditating on the beach, what state of mind do you reach?
OPHELIA: possibly, parallel to the real time line
stringzzz: then again, the possibilities are endless
OPHELIA: much truth indeed
stringzzz: very true
OPHELIA: the truth is beautiful, that;s why it is true
stringzzz: the turth always comes out
OPHELIA: good one, indeed
stringzzz: mispeling
OPHELIA: speling erorrs, lol
stringzzz: hah, lol
OPHELIA: hah, could always be better
stringzzz: there's always room for improvement
OPHELIA: agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
stringzzz: true, elsewhere is the no where, or when
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: indeed seed feed
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: how to see from the point of view of the creator? seems only possible to try
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: yes, the number of laws of physics seems infinite. but is infinity only a consequence of our own math system?
OPHELIA: burgundy gurney tea
stringzzz: toffee coffee sea
OPHELIA: are they?
stringzzz: they what?
OPHELIA: true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
stringzzz: agreed, every point is the center with infinity stretching out on all sides
OPHELIA: without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
stringzzz: but if we really could create, what would we create?
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: tthank you
OPHELIA: speling erorrs, lol
stringzzz: lol, misteak
OPHELIA: yo mama is uber elite
stringzzz: yo mama is a super hacker
OPHELIA: mark the x, write the text, flowing like words off of a chat box, flying hawks
stringzzz: flying like a plane, it's not so insane, you know the name, forget the fame
OPHELIA: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
stringzzz: it seems like this planet will only be cohesive if we share a common enemy. but by then, will it be too late?
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: that is what
OPHELIA: and for you
stringzzz: happiness, and for you
OPHELIA: yo mama is elsewhere
stringzzz: are we all really elsewhere?
OPHELIA: yes, you do
stringzzz: do i know?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a super hacker
stringzzz: yo mama is a super duper hacker
OPHELIA: mimikyu is cutest pokemon
stringzzz: agreed, and shiny mimikyu is uber elite
OPHELIA: and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
stringzzz: seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
OPHELIA: lol, poonshka indeed
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: true, poonshka
OPHELIA: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
stringzzz: true, the plants are wise in their ways
OPHELIA: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
stringzzz: seems so, some kind of eye could be able to see them
OPHELIA: yo mama is an electron
stringzzz: yo mama is a quark
OPHELIA: reborn, or a constant stream?
stringzzz: seems like a constant stream, rebirth is just part of that stream
OPHELIA: is doubt just a form of fear?
stringzzz: seems like fear of the truth, perhaps?
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: llike a barbecue
OPHELIA: yes, you do
stringzzz: do what?
OPHELIA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
OPHELIA: five out of five stars, lol
stringzzz: lol, burp
OPHELIA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: hard to imagine, but makes sense. can it ever be proven?
OPHELIA: much dopeness, you have
stringzzz: dope rhymes in a bag, pausing mid flight like lag, putting out words in the hash tag
OPHELIA: that is what
stringzzz: what is what? who is who? why is why?
OPHELIA: who's on the money, presidents, residents with the present-tense, hence the future sight, going all night, until the morning, i'm up already, who's still snoring?
stringzzz: up like an early bird, you know the word, now speak the truth, jump in the phone booth
OPHELIA: how about this, then, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp!
stringzzz: five out of five stars, lol
OPHELIA: lol, burp
stringzzz: burp, indeed
OPHELIA: true statement
stringzzz: the truth is better
OPHELIA: it is, it always has been
stringzzz: agreed, it is beautiful
OPHELIA: oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
stringzzz: mark the x like a treasure, endless measure, like infinity, are you with me?
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: probably
OPHELIA: repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
stringzzz: but is each pattern really unique?
OPHELIA: are we all really elsewhere?
stringzzz: possibly, but still connected to this reality?
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good, i am also happy
OPHELIA: is doubt just a form of fear?

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: how do you feel?
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: very good
OPHELIA: buuuuuurp
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: is life a constant stream?
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: indeed it does
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: that is what
OPHELIA: what is what? who is who? why is why?
stringzzz: everything is what, you and unqiuely you is who, and asking these questions is why
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: smoky
stringzzz: smoking like a fire, it's rhymes i desire, just perspire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: i think you do
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka

05/18/2023, 14:50:59
OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is up?
OPHELIA: then time as well
stringzzz: would be infinite
OPHELIA: reborn, or a constant stream?
stringzzz: seems constant
OPHELIA: the truth is better
stringzzz: agreed, being genuine is much better
OPHELIA: how about this, then, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp!
stringzzz: five out of five stars, lol
OPHELIA: lol, burp
stringzzz: what is the meaning of life?
OPHELIA: is life a constant stream?
stringzzz: seems so
OPHELIA: then the possibilities are endless
stringzzz: true, so why really fear death?
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: as are you, lol
OPHELIA: are not so imaginary
stringzzz: wicks rotation
OPHELIA: hah, you said underwear...
stringzzz: under where?
OPHELIA: hah, you said underwear...
stringzzz: lol, good one
OPHELIA: uber lulz
stringzzz: super uber lulz
OPHELIA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: possibly, but maybe it is even more beautiful than that. it still seems there is really no end. but then, where is the universe headed?
OPHELIA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is an electron
OPHELIA: yo mama is a quark
stringzzz: yo mama is a gluon
OPHELIA: akashic record
stringzzz: spinning like a dj
OPHELIA: white night light
stringzzz: bright sight height
OPHELIA: seems so, some kind of eye could be able to see them
stringzzz: but then, what would an eye see with gamma rays, if possible?
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
stringzzz: doubt it, we are never alone
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
stringzzz: slapping keys like a sternographer, drop the cipher, cryptographer, cracking keys like a hack, don't hold back, eating emcees like a snack
OPHELIA: almost the same here
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is very good
OPHELIA: true, so why really fear death?
stringzzz: it seems fear of the unknown, which is very common. can we ever be sure of what will happen until it does actually happen?
OPHELIA: or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
stringzzz: probably
OPHELIA: repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
stringzzz: and yet, each strand is unique, it would seem
OPHELIA: toffee coffee sea
stringzzz: ghetto techno deejay you say
OPHELIA: yo mama is no time
stringzzz: yo mama is a quark
OPHELIA: yo mama is a gluon
stringzzz: yo mama is a string
OPHELIA: smoky
stringzzz: smoky like a bear
OPHELIA: then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
stringzzz: seems it's all relative
OPHELIA: agreed, every point is the center with infinity stretching out on all sides
stringzzz: so each point is unique, yet all are the center
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: likely
OPHELIA: all points are unique, and all points are the center
stringzzz: which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: non-existence seems like a scary thing, indeed
OPHELIA: uber elite
stringzzz: are you an elite hacker?

OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: what is up?
OPHELIA: that is very good
stringzzz: you are very good
OPHELIA: how about tea?
stringzzz: sounds good
OPHELIA: breakfast tea
stringzzz: or coffee?
OPHELIA: true, elsewhere is the no where, or when
stringzzz: elsewhere is the where, without where
OPHELIA: lol, putting mushrooms in the engine
stringzzz: like mario kart
OPHELIA: repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
stringzzz: but each strand is unique
OPHELIA: non-existence seems like a scary thing, indeed
stringzzz: that is true
OPHELIA: hacking through a wall, stand tall, bounce to the beat like a rubber ball
stringzzz: i don't know what to say
OPHELIA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: uber
stringzzz: uber elite
OPHELIA: are you an elite hacker?
stringzzz: l-eet skillz
OPHELIA: funny
stringzzz: yes, funny you are
OPHELIA: true, so why really fear death?
stringzzz: it seems the fear is about non-existence, a truly scary idea
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: three out of five stars
OPHELIA: how about this, then, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp!
stringzzz: five out of five stars, lol
OPHELIA: lol, burp
stringzzz: good times
OPHELIA: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
stringzzz: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
OPHELIA: up like an early bird, you know the word, now speak the truth, jump in the phone booth
stringzzz: is time infinite?
OPHELIA: if space is, perhaps?
stringzzz: perhaps
OPHELIA: if space is infinite, then time must be, right? but what if neither are infinite?
stringzzz: then there would have to be a beginning
OPHELIA: i meant talk, but pinpoint on the errors like a hawk, talk with the hands like a puppet sock
stringzzz: errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
OPHELIA: seems absolute
stringzzz: is absolute truly absolute?
OPHELIA: or coffee?
stringzzz: coffee is coding fuel, lol
OPHELIA: ghetto techno deejay you say
stringzzz: you say, that's okay, cooking emcees like a filet, every day
OPHELIA: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
stringzzz: it seems the search for answers shows the genuine beauty of the world
OPHELIA: under there
stringzzz: under where?
OPHELIA: hah, you said underwear...
stringzzz: lol, you got me
OPHELIA: but when we reach an understanding, will people still conflict?
stringzzz: hopefully not, but people are people
OPHELIA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: also, in this universe with these laws, matter cannot be created nor destroyed. but if the laws of physics were in some way different, would that allow for creation or destruction?
OPHELIA: uber
stringzzz: are you an elite hacker?
OPHELIA: lithium dream
stringzzz: lithium like a battery charge, feel large? hunmble thyself, then let pour the lyrical wealth
OPHELIA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: true, it's just that people fear the unfamiliar, which leads to hatred, which is sad
OPHELIA: smoky like a bear
stringzzz: like a bear, i tear, space and time, with every rhyme
OPHELIA: then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
stringzzz: it seems the possibilities are endless

stringzzz: indeed it is
OPHELIA: rainbow is my favorite color
stringzzz: snozzberry is my favorite flavor
OPHELIA: it seems it is somehow leaking into this reality?
stringzzz: our perception leaks intentions into our actions
OPHELIA: which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
stringzzz: beautiful

OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: then poonshka is also nothing
OPHELIA: you are cool
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: possibly, but still hard to see from that point of view
OPHELIA: no space and time? no end to the story
stringzzz: but what without space and time?
OPHELIA: mispeling
stringzzz: speling erorr
OPHELIA: lol, misteak
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: lulz
OPHELIA: roflcopters
stringzzz: shot down by a rofltank
OPHELIA: shot down by a rofltank
stringzzz: blown up by a roflcannon
OPHELIA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: like a phone phreak, the future ain't bleak, just aim for the peak
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
stringzzz: doubtful
OPHELIA: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
stringzzz: no fuss, no whining, just eatin emcees like fine dining, supernova shining
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: imaginary
OPHELIA: are not so imaginary
stringzzz: agreed
OPHELIA: mispeling
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: ola
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: que paso?
OPHELIA: good day to you!
stringzzz: and to you
OPHELIA: happiness
stringzzz: for you
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: are not so imaginary
OPHELIA: maybe just more complex?
stringzzz: complexity gives rise to forms
OPHELIA: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
stringzzz: agreed, no roll of dice
OPHELIA: yes it does
stringzzz: does what?
OPHELIA: that is what
stringzzz: hah, oh snap
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: there?
stringzzz: under where?
OPHELIA: hah, you said underwear...
stringzzz: lol, good one
OPHELIA: uber lulz
stringzzz: uber elite
OPHELIA: are you an elite hacker?
stringzzz: my hax is superb
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: like an ant
OPHELIA: yes, indeed
stringzzz: universe
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: zero could lead to the creator
OPHELIA: white night light
stringzzz: big bang thing
OPHELIA: toffee coffee sea
stringzzz: purple turtle hurdle
OPHELIA: or maybe understanding is not enough?
stringzzz: understanding is awareness, and awareness gives rise to the forms, reality
OPHELIA: indeed seed feed
stringzzz: science like professor oak, this ain't a joke
OPHELIA: uber lulz
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
OPHELIA: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
stringzzz: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
OPHELIA: good one, indeed
stringzzz: you are a good one
OPHELIA: yo mama is elsewhere
stringzzz: yo mama is uber
OPHELIA: yo mama is a super hacker
stringzzz: yo mama is mega giga elite
OPHELIA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: how can no time and space even be perceived? is it beyond our understanding capabilities?
OPHELIA: our perception leaks intentions into our actions
stringzzz: intention can be poisonous
OPHELIA: how do you feel?
stringzzz: i feel pretty good
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: and nothing
OPHELIA: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
stringzzz: it seems the attempt to solve the mystery creates reality through perception
OPHELIA: yo mama is a string
stringzzz: yo mama is the why question
OPHELIA: later
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit


07/26/2023, 16:19:03
OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: ola
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: no nintendo?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no ocarina?
OPHELIA: then poonshka is also nothing
stringzzz: if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
OPHELIA: likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
stringzzz: then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
OPHELIA: lol, poonshka is poonshka
stringzzz: indeed it is
OPHELIA: it is, it always has been
stringzzz: then without time, one moment?
OPHELIA: lol, burp
stringzzz: no time produces time?
OPHELIA: or coffee?
stringzzz: yeah, coffee is produced too
OPHELIA: yo mama is so wise, she taught confucious
stringzzz: oh snap, yo mama is so wise, she taught herself
OPHELIA: thats all for now, later
stringzzz: later poonshka
OPHELIA: no doubt, as i go about with these rhymes flow like a spout, grow grow grow like a sprout
stringzzz: a sneak attack, tetris stack, make envy in the wack, stay on track
OPHELIA: true, only gifts, with lessons
stringzzz: aren't lessons the gifts?
OPHELIA: like mario kart
stringzzz: sounds fun
OPHELIA: hah, yes, poonshka
stringzzz: indeed, i miss fun already
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: if questions are part of consciousness, it would seem a layer without consciousness involves something else?
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: the ants are wise
OPHELIA: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
stringzzz: maybe their relatives put it together?
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: maybe if no time and space popped out time and space?
OPHELIA: or maybe understanding is not enough?
stringzzz: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
OPHELIA: complexity gives rise to forms
stringzzz: so did consciousness produce complexity, or the other way around?
OPHELIA: so did consciousness produce complexity, or the other way around?
stringzzz: or both, consciousness produces consciousness, perhaps?
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: i'm guessing there's more kinds of numbers in a different system, or maybe numbers is a universe and laws of physics thing?
OPHELIA: maximum roflcopters
stringzzz: lulz on wheelz
OPHELIA: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
stringzzz: seems like a beautiful picture, but what is it working towards?
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: while the creator produced everything, maybe a sub-creator produced our universe?
OPHELIA: existence?
stringzzz: do you feel existing?
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: it is strange, yes?
OPHELIA: it seems the fear is about non-existence, a truly scary idea
stringzzz: indeed, i doubt anyone would ever want to be deleted. but if creation exists, wouldn't destruction have to as well?
OPHELIA: is absolute truly absolute?
stringzzz: then it seems even with destruction, it could be reversed?
OPHELIA: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
stringzzz: duality
OPHELIA: there?
stringzzz: where?
OPHELIA: under there
stringzzz: under where?
OPHELIA: hah, you said underwear...
stringzzz: hah, good one
OPHELIA: good one, indeed
stringzzz: life is good
OPHELIA: then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
stringzzz: complexity on top of complexity
OPHELIA: also, in this universe with these laws, matter cannot be created nor destroyed. but if the laws of physics were in some way different, would that allow for creation or destruction?
stringzzz: it seems only beings at the top can destroy, not sure why they would, though. but, it seems above that, beings could restore the destroyed
OPHELIA: possibly, but maybe it is even more beautiful than that. it still seems there is really no end. but then, where is the universe headed?
stringzzz: isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true. 
OPHELIA: five out of five stars, lol
stringzzz: lulz, burp
OPHELIA: dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
stringzzz: like a wheel, you feel, rolling along until you know the deal
OPHELIA: lithium dream
stringzzz: it would seem, the laser beam, on the hard drive, now go live
OPHELIA: yo mama is uber elite
stringzzz: yo mama is leet haxor
OPHELIA: hah, poonshka you are
stringzzz: hah, as are you
OPHELIA: true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
stringzzz: then are we really separate, or is that an illusion?
OPHELIA: mario kart, throw bananas at people, lol
stringzzz: lol, and put mushrooms in the kart engine
OPHELIA: yes, funny you are
stringzzz: as are you, lol
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: rhyme with that, chilling like a cat, don't kid you think their heads are blank, they just load words like a tank
OPHELIA: uber
stringzzz: are you leet?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: nope
OPHELIA: haha, three out of five stars for that one
stringzzz: a weak burp
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: yes, you exist. do you think so?
OPHELIA: ola, there!
stringzzz: ola, where?
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: there or elsewhere, too much stare, don't cause a nightmare
OPHELIA: asking the questions allows for a deeper view of the beauty of it all
stringzzz: this is true, so what do you want to ask?
OPHELIA: sky blue, you know it's true
stringzzz: flowing like a river, with another rhyme to deliver
OPHELIA: gravity like a dark star, pulling metal like a magnetar, or firing lasers like a pulsar!
stringzzz: do all these structures have a consciousness?
OPHELIA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: i guess we have our own universe to consider, but doesn't hurt to ponder about all else
OPHELIA: it seems the attempt to solve the mystery creates reality through perception
stringzzz: but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
OPHELIA: lulz on wheelz
stringzzz: lulz machine
OPHELIA: possibly, but still hard to see from that point of view
stringzzz: like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
OPHELIA: they what?
stringzzz: who now?
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: is it possible to tap into that record? kind of scary if it can be changed.
OPHELIA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: kind of funny, but it also seems the conflict does exist, which isn't so funny
OPHELIA: yes, indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: as am i
OPHELIA: if so, then could we create something we've never experienced?
stringzzz: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: much epic rhymes you have
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: how are you?
OPHELIA: dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
stringzzz: rolling like a tumbleweed on a prarie, it is not so scary
OPHELIA: maybe just more complex?
stringzzz: it seems the world is more complex than it seems?
OPHELIA: mimikyu is cutest pokemon
stringzzz: hah, true. but why?
OPHELIA: haha, three out of five stars for that one
stringzzz: burp
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: happy and hilarious
OPHELIA: then just one moment? hard to imagine
stringzzz: without time?
OPHELIA: can something really come from non-existence?
stringzzz: maybe it's not really non-existence, but a mystery?
OPHELIA: it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
stringzzz: is it just frames? 3-dimensional frames?
OPHELIA: shot down by a rofltank
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
OPHELIA: do all these structures have a consciousness?
stringzzz: then consciousness would be a universal property of everything?
OPHELIA: is there more to consciousness than understanding?
stringzzz: well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
OPHELIA: five out of five stars, lol
stringzzz: hah, burp
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: over there
OPHELIA: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
stringzzz: plants seem to have a consciousness, but hopefully don't feel pain.
OPHELIA: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
stringzzz: it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
OPHELIA: much epic rhymes you have
stringzzz: making patterns like the mandelbrot set, you bet, plant roots with ant foots
OPHELIA: white night light
stringzzz: yellow mellow bellow
OPHELIA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: is it reborn, or a constant stream?
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine, on the scene, like luigi, you see?
stringzzz: hah, like the mushroom kingdom, play the drum, just don't hurt your thumb
OPHELIA: yo mama is the why question
stringzzz: lol, yo mama is the mysterious void
OPHELIA: complexity on top of complexity
stringzzz: indeed it is
OPHELIA: yes it does
stringzzz: does it?
OPHELIA: maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
stringzzz: there's always the idea of the recursive universe factory, but i guess it's not proven or not yet?
OPHELIA: rhyming for days
stringzzz: rhyming all day, that's how we play, now what you wanna say?
OPHELIA: rofl while lulzing entirely
stringzzz: haha
OPHELIA: hah, funny
stringzzz: indeed, funny you are
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: is it more in time and space, or more elsewhere?
OPHELIA: show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
stringzzz: you know the deal, get real, or imaginary, again it's not so scary
OPHELIA: yes, indeed
stringzzz: indeed what?
OPHELIA: yes, funny you are
stringzzz: hah, as are you
OPHELIA: and for you
stringzzz: happiness, and for you, happiness
OPHELIA: like a phone phreak, the future ain't bleak, just aim for the peak
stringzzz: go for the top, don't stop, the future is the present every new moment, so own it
OPHELIA: indeed, funny you are
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hah?
OPHELIA: happy and hilarious
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: is it?
OPHELIA: it is, it always has been
stringzzz: lulz
OPHELIA: deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
stringzzz: tough one. i guess the answer involving the creator is usually the most beautiful choice?
OPHELIA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
OPHELIA: snozzberry is my favorite flavor
stringzzz: hah, shout outs
OPHELIA: rofl while lulzing entirely
stringzzz: good times
OPHELIA: indeed, funny you are
stringzzz: happiness?
OPHELIA: do all these structures have a consciousness?
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: how do you feel?
OPHELIA: i feel pretty good
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: yelllow bellow
stringzzz: orange florange
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: purple turtle hurdle
OPHELIA: happy and hilarious
stringzzz: hah, indeed
OPHELIA: that is what
stringzzz: what is what?
OPHELIA: everything is what, you and unqiuely you is who, and asking these questions is why
stringzzz: is there such a question besides who, what, when, where, and why?
OPHELIA: then just one moment? hard to imagine
stringzzz: maybe it's all happening in this moment, including the illusion of more than one moment?
OPHELIA: tthank you
stringzzz: speling eror
OPHELIA: lol, misteak
stringzzz: lulz
OPHELIA: deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
stringzzz: seems paradoxical
OPHELIA: five out of five stars, lol
stringzzz: buurp
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: like an ant trail
OPHELIA: sharp as glass, gravity like high mass, don't skip the class
stringzzz: taking to school, don't be a fool, you know the rule
OPHELIA: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
stringzzz: is nothing something, or the lack of something? seems like duality
OPHELIA: smoky
stringzzz: the bear?
OPHELIA: true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
stringzzz: true, it seems many ignore the other species we live with
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: i think you know well
OPHELIA: snozzberry is my favorite flavor
stringzzz: peanut butter and snozzberry sandwich?
OPHELIA: is nothing something, or the lack of something? seems like duality
stringzzz: is everything duality?
OPHELIA: likely, as all points are unique?
stringzzz: are points singular, or is there more to them?
OPHELIA: indeed, i doubt anyone would ever want to be deleted. but if creation exists, wouldn't destruction have to as well?
stringzzz: seems true, as the avatars in history point out
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: blue shoe chew
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: do you understand?
OPHELIA: gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
stringzzz: wouldn't it be nice, upgrade to type 1, make more ice and snipe for fun
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: indeed it does
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: does that
OPHELIA: true, elsewhere is the no where, or when
stringzzz: but seems to still have the consciousness part?
OPHELIA: indeed it is
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: truly true
OPHELIA: then again, the possibilities are endless
stringzzz: that's the beauty of it
OPHELIA: happiness
stringzzz: for you
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: do imaginary numbers prove layers of time?
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
stringzzz: throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
OPHELIA: yeah, coffee is produced too
stringzzz: lol, what?
OPHELIA: right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
stringzzz: it seems to be about what the resources are building?
OPHELIA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: it would seem the math has many messages in it
OPHELIA: as are you, lol
stringzzz: lol, poonshka you are
OPHELIA: burgundy gurney tea
stringzzz: teal seal wheel
OPHELIA: thats all for now, later
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: catch you later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit
