OPHELIA: are imaginary numbers layers of time?
stringzzz: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: yo mama is a singularity
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
OPHELIA: lemonade?
stringzzz: how about tea?
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here
stringzzz: no fear, you are here, too
OPHELIA: thank you

OPHELIA: yo mama is a big bang
stringzzz: gravity would be at max
OPHELIA: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
stringzzz: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: blue shoe who knew
OPHELIA: florange
stringzzz: florange rhymes with orange
OPHELIA: are imaginary numbers layers of time?

OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?

OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
OPHELIA: yo mama is no time
stringzzz: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: as are the bees
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time

OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper

OPHELIA: yo mama is a stone tablet
stringzzz: yo mama is no time
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: but in a singularity, the laws of physics would be totally different than what we experience, maybe? so maybe that accounts for something working with no time or space. no idea what that set of physics would actually be like though.
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ants are wise
OPHELIA: as are the bees

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: mystical
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: indeed, gives me a headache
OPHELIA: go for it

OPHELIA: yo mama is a big bang
stringzzz: yo mama is a singularity

OPHELIA: like a sword, electron hoarde, throwing photons like the lord
