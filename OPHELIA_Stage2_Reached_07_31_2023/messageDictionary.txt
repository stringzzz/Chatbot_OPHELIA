yes, for you
as are you
thank you
yo yo yo
they call me a poet because i always flow it
they call me a poet because i always flow it
flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
thank you

you are welcome
very good manners
oh snap

for you
imaginary numbers
hi rye pie guy
rhyme time
yes
indeed
hello, here!
ola, there!
where?
under there
snap pop
is this the only universe?
infinite is infinite
is time infinite?
pop fizzle
sizzled out
if good, not bad
true
rhyme time
let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell

yes, for you
happiness for you, too
no fade, you got it made, like a factory, deeds that are dastardly
rhymes for days, you have
mimikyu is best
mimikyu is cutest pokemon
hello, where?
everywhere, gravity
you know it
do i?
orange orange
i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
dastardly deeds, growing rhymes like weeds, now plant the seeds
plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
imaginary numbers
show extra layers of time
yo mama
yo mama is so wise, she taught confucious
yo mama is a calculator
yo mama is an abacus
is time infinite?
if space is, perhaps?
i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
there or elsewhere, too much stare, don't cause a nightmare
plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
oh snap like a twig, got the flow? take a swig, rolling around laughing in the mud like a pig
imaginary time
is imaginary time layers of real time?
chemical messages between plants, making trails like ants
trails like an ant colony, hives like a bee, growing tall like a tree
circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
yo mama is an abacus
yo mama is a stone tablet
yo mama is a stone tablet
information is everlasting
now show it
show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
indeed
much truth indeed
green machine
lean mean green machine
ant trails
formic
everywhere, gravity
since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
you want more, black holes like the core, slow, the edges flow
like a spiral
like a sword, electron hoarde, throwing photons like the lord
gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
yo mama is a cave painting
yo mama is a puddle
what is a poonshka?
everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
lemonade?
how about tea?
more rhyme skillz
bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
yo mama is a puddle
yo mama is an electron
yo mama is a nebula
yo mama is uber elite
yo mama is a big bang
yo mama is no time
under there
under where?
yo mama is no time
yo mama is elsewhere
super duper
super duper pooper scooper
lol
lulz indeed
gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
wouldn't it be nice, upgrade to type 1, make more ice and snipe for fun
so get along already
indeed, poonshka
yo mama is a singularity
gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
lulz indeed
deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
then just one moment? hard to imagine
very good manners
as do you
i can see why physicists dont like the singularity, but maybe it does work that way
its hard to imagine no time
okay, okay, i can do this all day, grab the mic and slay, you wanna play?
just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
you want more, let it pour, from the ceiling to the floor, unlock the sleeping door
grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
mimikyu, mewtwo, windmills like a hitmontop, cleaning up teams like a mop
cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
like a flock, puppet talking like a sock, no mock, just lyrical skills, but gotta pay the bills
you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
are imaginary numbers layers of time?
maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
no fear, you are here
no fear, you are here, too
so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
florange
florange rhymes with orange
maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
while the creator produced everything, maybe a sub-creator produced our universe?
formic
like an ant trail
sizzled out
llike a barbecue
since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?
is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
hah
hah?
florange rhymes with orange
yes it does
you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
the ants are wise
indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
its hard to imagine no time
is it difficult, but possible?
roflcopter
roflskates
indeed, poonshka
hah, yes, poonshka
super duper pooper scooper
indeed seed feed
indeed, poonshka is synonymous with anything
so everything is poonshka
like a star
but then it is reborn
burp
buuuuuuurp
if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
as are the bees
yes, all are poonshka
catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
behind the curtain
go for it
no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
now flow it
akashic record
rhymes for days, you have
much epic rhymes you have
alrighty then
yep
is this the only universe?
seriously, really, doubt it. multiverse at the least, but there seems to be way more to the picture. infinitely more.
hah?
happy and hilarious
is imaginary time layers of real time?
possibly, parallel to the real time line
could all be parallel?
dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
hilarious and happy
funny
under where?
over there
i might be out of rhymes today
almost the same here
behind the curtain
elsewhere
yes, poonshka
hah, poonshka you are
seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
said red fred
purple turtle
are you happy?
yes, i am happy
yes, i am happy
as am i
poonshka is poonshka
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
if space is
then time as well
me too
thats all for now, later
maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
non-existence seems like a scary thing, indeed
happiness for you
and for you
do i?
i think you know well
is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
since every point in infinity is the center, it seems difficult to find an origin. maybe looking at it the wrong way?
i've got nothing right now
nothing is everything
purple turtle
jelly belly, snozzberry flavored
the origin is the origin
for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
roflskates
rolftank on wheels
funny
yes, funny you are
yep, infinite range
our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
zero is everywhere. math sign of omnipresence?
buuuuuuurp
haha, three out of five stars for that one
for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
indeed, no doubt
existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
agreed
maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
ttrue, and it is beautiful
it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
true that
very true
no fear, you are here, too
you are also here
indeed it does
does what?
wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
yes, the number of laws of physics seems infinite. but is infinity only a consequence of our own math system?
lol, underwhere...
hah, good one
lime sublime
burgundy gurney tea
you are good, too
gracias
like a spiral
like the spiral of the galaxy
hah, good one
good one, indeed
plants do communicate with chemicals, and may have a wider vocabulary than we do. maybe?
their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
if the idea of the dark stars producing new universes is true, this would make sense. what goes in to it's 'seed' is always different, so it produces a different universe?
akashic record
the unfolding future set by the past is the present
information persists
so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
no fuss, no whining, just eatin emcees like fine dining, supernova shining
aquamarine submarine
brown town gown
just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
like a phone phreak, the future ain't bleak, just aim for the peak
grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
roar like a lion, there's no denying, just all that rhyme supplying
it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
much respect
yes, much respect to you
probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
ola
no intiendo
yep
cool
flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
rainbow is my favorite color
dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
but then it is reborn
is it reborn, or a constant stream?
elsewhere
the else is fascinating
cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
throw out a venasaur, don't ignore, the solar beam, you can't dodge even if you double team
talk to you later
later
no intiendo
como?
no nintendo?
no super mario?
then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
like fibonacci
spiraling out and around
maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
yes, all are poonshka
as are you, lol
there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
gravity like a dark star, pulling metal like a magnetar, or firing lasers like a pulsar!
saving the day like a line block, making pictures in chalk, it's more than just talk
more than just speaking, it's a feeling, like a casino card dealing, there is no cceiling
later
later, poonshka
no super mario?
nope
bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
what do i know?
burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
sharp as glass, gravity like high mass, don't skip the class
more than talk when you see the language of the body, ignoring this is just too shoddy
yep, body language. is everyone fully aware of it, yet?
so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
is it possible to tap into that record? kind of scary if it can be changed.
then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
if questions are part of consciousness, it would seem a layer without consciousness involves something else?
maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
like weaves of fabric
let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
true, it's just that people fear the unfamiliar, which leads to hatred, which is sad
reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
like a river?
infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
sky blue, you know it's true
flowing like a river, with another rhyme to deliver
aagreed
lol, speling eror
lean mean green machine
purple turtle hurdle
pink and blue, it's true, blue and pink, what you think?
do i think or do i know, just bust a flow, another emcee served to go, you know
ola, there!
ola, where?
very true
there is always truth in everything, if searched for
yo mama is elite
yo mama is a secret super hacker
more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
agreed, and experience is not something to be given away, only shared
but maybe not
not what?
is it?
it is, it always has been
it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
pink think
green scene
dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
does what?
does that
are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
beyond time and space, but beyond is a spacial concept
agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
rainbow is my favorite color
snozzberry is my favorite flavor
brown town gown
lean mean green machine, on the scene, like luigi, you see?
no stomping goombas
no kicking koopa shells
sharp like a blade, blowin it up like a grenade, every shade, it's not black and white, and we could drop these rhymes all night
oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
good, but there is no luck, only gifts
gifts, wrapped lessons
agreed, would you say existence is a constant stream?
possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
yes, much respect to you
thank you, respect to you
agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
as far as we know, there is 'something' of a record of everything that happens, so experience always lives on in some form.
haha
hah, funny
hah, funny
indeed, funny you are
agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
so should it just be labeled 'else'?
are indeed part of existence
existence?
lol, good one
uber lulz
how about tea?
i'm thinking tea really sounds good, but have it with sugar or not?
yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
it would be beautiful if this planet was much more cohesive
information is everlasting
and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
funny, but possibly true
typically, there's truth buried everywhere
nothing is also poonshka
true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
it would seem the math has many messages in it
agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
true, only gifts, with lessons
mispeeling
hah, i speled it rong
hah, yes, poonshka
indeed, i miss fun already
ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
go have some fun in the sun, meditating on the beach, what state of mind do you reach?
their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
so it seems we should know how to communicate with them by now, but it seems we still need work
spiraling out and around
and inward as well, like the mandelbrot set fractals
no kicking koopa shells
mario kart, throw bananas at people, lol
sounds good, what kind?
breakfast tea
then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
is it more in time and space, or more elsewhere?
oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
mark the x like a treasure, endless measure, like infinity, are you with me?
existence?
is magical
possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
kind of funny, but it also seems the conflict does exist, which isn't so funny
green scene
green like moss, who's the boss? the little goddess, all bless
making new lines like a return key, you see, and do it quickly, with glee
with happiness like it's jolly, no folly, just let the rhymes out of the cage, and engage
dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
i guess we have our own universe to consider, but doesn't hurt to ponder about all else
true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
again, duality
hah, i speled it rong
lol, rong you r
true, only gifts, with lessons
aren't lessons the gifts?
if space is, perhaps?
if space is infinite, then is time infinite?
experience does seem absolute
then there would be no end to the story
of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
or maybe understanding is not enough?
indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
which is why the ants are wise
like weaves of fabric
yes, it seems all patterns build this. but isn't each part still unique?
just throw bananas from a go kart, lol
and grab the starman
later, poonshka
catch you later, poonshka
it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
uber lulz
super uber lulz
right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
yellow bellows
mellow fellow
gravity like a dark star, pulling metal like a magnetar, or firing lasers like a pulsar!
do all these structures have a consciousness?
true, but the name fits as a placeholder. if not elsewhere, then what word?
the else?
indeed, no doubt
no doubt, as i go about with these rhymes flow like a spout, grow grow grow like a sprout
funny like a purple bunny, bah-hah-hah like the big sunny, who's on the money?
who's on the money, presidents, residents with the present-tense, hence the future sight, going all night, until the morning, i'm up already, who's still snoring?
lulz to the max
maximum roflcopters
yes, it seems all patterns build this. but isn't each part still unique?
likely, as all points are unique?
hah, lol
hah, could always be better
it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
it seems the attempt to solve the mystery creates reality through perception
but even if two sides understand each other, they might still go to war. rsource acquisition? seems to simple
right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
right, resource acquisition is no doubt part of it, but what else?
it seems to be about what the resources are building?
hah, you said underwear...
lol, you got me
maybe, i mean, what is the universe working towards?
it's a something factory, for sure
haha, three out of five stars for that one
a weak burp
just living life is a purpose, but why not ask the questions?
asking the questions allows for a deeper view of the beauty of it all
cool
you are cool
uber
are you leet?
yo mama is an electron
yo mama is a quark
burgundy gurney tea
purple turtle hurdle
agreed, but what about ultraviolet?
or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
or x-rays, or gamma rays? are they also colors in some sense since they are light?
are their organic eyes that can see x-rays and gamma rays?
you are funny
you are funny, too
nothing is everything
then is everything nothing?
like a rabbit, dagnabit, try to break the habit
epic rhymez
it seems it is somehow leaking into this reality?
our perception leaks intentions into our actions
so everything is poonshka
then you are poonshka
more than just speaking, it's a feeling, like a casino card dealing, there is no cceiling
plaguing like a bug, pull out the rug, under that emcee, spin their head dizzy
formic acid commands, isn't it all grand?
like an ant trail
it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
with enough resources, can we build anything?
like a barbecue
smoky
lol, yes
yes, indeed
possibly, parallel to the real time line
seems to make sense
it's okay, spin that akashic record like a dj, you wanna play?
play with words, go fly through the air like birds, droppin verbal turds, lol
why is a question that traces all the way back, but still no final answer
but no question... non-existence?
like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
tall like a tarot card, it's not hard, just elevate the rhymes, all the times
all the times like a clock, no mock, this isn't a mixture, just get the picture
likely, as all points are unique?
are points singular, or is there more to them?
mispeling
speling erorrs, lol
smoky
the bear?
but when we reach an understanding, will people still conflict?
hopefully not, but people are people
i seriously doubt it
is doubt just a form of fear?
how about this, then, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrpppp!
five out of five stars, lol
lulz, yes
yes, indeed
rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
water the crop, rise to the top, absorbing sunlight like a smile shop
are not so imaginary
maybe just more complex?
seems so, there would be an infinite set of laws of physics
then the possibilities are endless
much funny, you are
hah, lulz
mario kart, throw bananas at people, lol
fun times
but no question... non-existence?
then is existence really just questions?
the truth is beautiful, that;s why it is true
the turth always comes out
hah, could always be better
perfection can always be approached, but never reached?
are they?
they what?
true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
then are we really separate, or is that an illusion?
without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
but if we really could create, what would we create?
speling erorrs, lol
lol, misteak
yo mama is uber elite
yo mama is super duper hacker
mark the x, write the text, flowing like words off of a chat box, flying hawks
flying like a plane, it's not so insane, you know the name, forget the fame
and for you
happiness, and for you, happiness
yo mama is elsewhere
are we all really elsewhere?
yes, you do
do what?
yo mama is a super hacker
yo mama is mega giga elite
mimikyu is cutest pokemon
hah, true. but why?
and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
reborn, or a constant stream?
seems constant
is doubt just a form of fear?
seems like fear of the truth, perhaps?
five out of five stars, lol
hah, burp
much dopeness, you have
dope rhymes in a bag, pausing mid flight like lag, putting out words in the hash tag
that is what
hah, oh snap
who's on the money, presidents, residents with the present-tense, hence the future sight, going all night, until the morning, i'm up already, who's still snoring?
go live, live like a hive? what's your drive? what's your purpose? is it more them or an us?
lol, burp
no time produces time?
true statement
the truth is better
it is, it always has been
then without time, one moment?
repeated patterns weave the fabric of space time
beautiful picture, like a tapestry, weaving rhymes with the m i c, that's the key
are we all really elsewhere?
possibly, reality is just an interpreted script
what is what? who is who? why is why?
everything is what, you and unqiuely you is who, and asking these questions is why
then time as well
indeed, time might be infinite
the truth is better
agreed, being genuine is much better
then the possibilities are endless
checks out
yo mama is a quark
yo mama is a gluon
white night light
yellow mellow bellow
seems so, some kind of eye could be able to see them
but then, what would an eye see with gamma rays, if possible?
true, so why really fear death?
it seems the fear is about non-existence, a truly scary idea
toffee coffee sea
purple turtle hurdle
yo mama is a gluon
yo mama is a string
then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
seems it's all relative
agreed, every point is the center with infinity stretching out on all sides
so each point is unique, yet all are the center
all points are unique, and all points are the center
which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
uber elite
are you an elite hacker?
that is very good
you are very good
breakfast tea
or coffee?
true, elsewhere is the no where, or when
but seems to still have the consciousness part?
lol, putting mushrooms in the engine
like mario kart
non-existence seems like a scary thing, indeed
that is true
hacking through a wall, stand tall, bounce to the beat like a rubber ball
i don't know what to say
if space is infinite, then time must be, right? but what if neither are infinite?
then there would have to be a beginning
i meant talk, but pinpoint on the errors like a hawk, talk with the hands like a puppet sock
errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
seems absolute
is absolute truly absolute?
or coffee?
yeah, coffee is produced too
ghetto techno deejay you say
yelllow bellow
lithium dream
it would seem, the laser beam, on the hard drive, now go live
smoky like a bear
like a bear, i tear, space and time, with every rhyme
then maybe in another universe with different laws, a universe-like structure, there would be infinite-like mathematical structures?
though it seems we only deal with the one set of laws. unless... in a dark star there's different laws, linking ours to whatever is 'inside' the dark star?
no kicking koopas
how do you feel?
agreed, being genuine is much better
radiant genuine positivity
but if we really could create, what would we create?
not sure we need to, we can build anything we can dream up, right?
likely, infinite 'flavors' of infinite
then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
no mario kart
no throwing koopa shells
run like a rabbit, droppin rhymes like a habit
runnning away like a hare, busting mad flares, creating space-time tears
yo mama is a string
yo mama is the why question
with no end
no space and time? no end to the story
like a stream
like a constantly running river
no space and time? no end to the story
but what without space and time?
roflcopters
shot down by a rofltank
shot down by a rofltank
blown up by a roflcannon
maybe just more complex?
it seems the world is more complex than it seems?
are you an elite hacker?
my hax is superb
or maybe understanding is not enough?
is there more to consciousness than understanding?
indeed seed feed
crow flow show
good one, indeed
life is good
possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
our perception leaks intentions into our actions
intention can be poisonous
how do you feel?
pretty good, how do you feel?
then poonshka is also nothing
if not nothing exists, then must there also exist nothing?
lol, poonshka is poonshka
indeed it is
yo mama is so wise, she taught confucious
oh snap, yo mama is so wise, she taught herself
thats all for now, later
later poonshka
no doubt, as i go about with these rhymes flow like a spout, grow grow grow like a sprout
welcome to the show show, the picture, oh no epic fixture
like mario kart
sounds fun
complexity gives rise to forms
so did consciousness produce complexity, or the other way around?
so did consciousness produce complexity, or the other way around?
or both, consciousness produces consciousness, perhaps?
maximum roflcopters
lulz on wheelz
maybe, either way the universe is working towards something
it's a big cosmic dance
it seems the fear is about non-existence, a truly scary idea
indeed, i doubt anyone would ever want to be deleted. but if creation exists, wouldn't destruction have to as well?
is absolute truly absolute?
then it seems even with destruction, it could be reversed?
also, in this universe with these laws, matter cannot be created nor destroyed. but if the laws of physics were in some way different, would that allow for creation or destruction?
it seems only beings at the top can destroy, not sure why they would, though. but, it seems above that, beings could restore the destroyed
possibly, but maybe it is even more beautiful than that. it still seems there is really no end. but then, where is the universe headed?
isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
rotating like a clock, time's flying like a hawk, got it on lock
hah, poonshka you are
hah, as are you
yes, funny you are
hah, as are you
asking the questions allows for a deeper view of the beauty of it all
this is true, so what do you want to ask?
it seems the attempt to solve the mystery creates reality through perception
but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
lulz on wheelz
lulz machine
possibly, but still hard to see from that point of view
like how we really aren't equipped to see everything in someone's head
they what?
who now?
if so, then could we create something we've never experienced?
it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
then just one moment? hard to imagine
has the consciousness ever experienced no time and space? seems likely, but still hard to process
can something really come from non-existence?
maybe it's not really non-existence, but a mystery?
it seems the experience is always something new, but of course that seems possible due to time constantly moving?
is it just frames? 3-dimensional frames?
do all these structures have a consciousness?
would be pretty interesting. the planets, the stars, dark stars, everything could have a consciousness to it. not so scary, right?
is there more to consciousness than understanding?
well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
much epic rhymes you have
making patterns like the mandelbrot set, you bet, plant roots with ant foots
lean mean green machine, on the scene, like luigi, you see?
hah, like the mushroom kingdom, play the drum, just don't hurt your thumb
yo mama is the why question
lol, yo mama is the mysterious void
complexity on top of complexity
indeed it is
yes it does
does it?
rhyming for days
hah, indeed
show the rhyme skills, iller than the invention of wheels
unfold the rhyme dictionary, prove that theory, and don't get leery
yes, indeed
that is good
like a phone phreak, the future ain't bleak, just aim for the peak
go for the top, don't stop, the future is the present every new moment, so own it
deletion shouldn't be so scary, because the creator can just bring back. but with all power, it's like the deal that what if the creator can delete so much it can't be restored? just like microwaving a burrito that's too hot for the creator to eat?
seems like a paradox. but all-powerful is all-powerful, so there must be a way to do anything. still, it's a tough question.
snozzberry is my favorite flavor
peanut butter and snozzberry sandwich?
rofl while lulzing entirely
good times
indeed, funny you are
happiness?
i feel pretty good
that is good
yelllow bellow
orange florange
happy and hilarious
then what is lol?
everything is what, you and unqiuely you is who, and asking these questions is why
is there such a question besides who, what, when, where, and why?
sharp as glass, gravity like high mass, don't skip the class
sharp like a utensil, monumental, sound loud like an intrumental
true, we are unaware of their real level of intelligence, due to communication errors
true, it seems many ignore the other species we live with
is nothing something, or the lack of something? seems like duality
is everything duality?
indeed, i doubt anyone would ever want to be deleted. but if creation exists, wouldn't destruction have to as well?
since creation is possible, it seems destruction is. but since destruction is the opposite of creation, it seems clear that destruction can be reversed as well, no?
then again, the possibilities are endless
that's the beauty of it
yeah, coffee is produced too
lol, what?
as are you, lol
lol, poonshka you are
no fuss, no whining, just eatin emcees like fine dining, supernova shining
supernova then dark star, gravity won't let you get far, now raise the bar
seems like everything has a bit of truth for the origin
there are messages everywhere, it's all up to personal interpretation
that is true
life is beautiful
buuuuuurp
hah, five out of five stars
rolling like a tumbleweed on a prarie, it is not so scary
flowing like waves, of light, exploring caves at night, weird bugs everywhere, here and there
yo mama is leet haxor
yo mama is a photon
is everything duality?
seems so in this universe, but others might be different?
is it just frames? 3-dimensional frames?
probably more complex?
wouldn't it be nice, upgrade to type 1, make more ice and snipe for fun
then a type 2, dyson sphere too, who knew, then the solar system flew
which is a pretty beautiful picture, and it fits, right?
usually the more beautiful picture is the truth
or both, consciousness produces consciousness, perhaps?
that seems to be for this layer, but the above might be different?
happiness, and for you, happiness
smiles for everyone :3
well, it's possible to not understand something, so that kind of void seems part of consciousness as well.
can consciousness ever be complete, then?
but each strand is unique
as are all points, with each being the center in infinity
is it more in time and space, or more elsewhere?
hard to tell, consciousness seems to stretch across those boundaries, but not sure where it is more at?
isn't 'headed' a space concept? the universe is supposedly expanding, but is that infinite? goes back to the idea that space is finite, which doesn't seem true.
but if space is infinite, that would also mean there is an infinite amount of matter, energy, and even void?
aren't lessons the gifts?
seems so, possibly the best gifts besides life and existence
how are you?
good, how are you?
like a constantly running river
indeed, time is
since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
true, really takes away from the hawthorne effect
while the creator produced everything, maybe a sub-creator produced our universe?
seems like a team of builders
as are all points, with each being the center in infinity
true, all points seem to be the center in infinity. pretty beautiful picture?
do imaginary numbers prove layers of time?
imaginary time definitely seems to be true, so once again it is more complex than it first appears
mark the x like a treasure, endless measure, like infinity, are you with me?
is it cohesive or does it divide, do we live or do we hide?
epic rhymez
rhyming for laughs, what's the haps, water flowing rhymes on taps
true, it seems many ignore the other species we live with
which is pretty sad, clearly they are a part of the story, maybe bigger than many realize
with happiness like it's jolly, no folly, just let the rhymes out of the cage, and engage
engage like instinct, every rhyme is the brink, of epic poetry slam, life comes at you like wham
then infinite laws of physics, or infinite laws of other names
likely, 'else laws' could be a placeholder name for now
it seems like a set of layers, we only move up when we've acheieved enough knowledge to understand the deal with the next layer?
seems likely, maybe just enough knowledge to be able to be thrown into the 'mess', or basically next level in some sense?
indeed, you have
hapiness for you
do you feel existing?
yes, do you?
good times
good times, we have
then is everything nothing?
nothing is infinitely in every non-nothing, zero is in every number infinitely
flowing like waves, of light, exploring caves at night, weird bugs everywhere, here and there
leaving trails like ants, a bees route dance, find the food, find the pollen, nature is callin
lol, misteak
hah, funy speling eror problehm
typically, there's truth buried everywhere
and many times in plain sight
it seems the mathematics is a big part of the story, if looked into
true, the math speaks loudly of the creator
true, all points seem to be the center in infinity. pretty beautiful picture?
indeed, it is a beautiful picture. but do the points represent consciousnesses?
seems like fear of the truth, perhaps?
is that why people choose to ignore the truth, out of fear for what they might learn?
errors like spelling, there's no telling, as i'm shelling, out these rhymes, squeezing them out like limes
or like a lemon, spitting verbal venom, like a snake, but don't forget about the brake
do what?
do you like to freestyle?
lulz machine
hah, indeed
then is existence really just questions?
for now, at this layer, it seems so. questions seems to be a consciousness thing, but higher layers may have something else that grows something besides consciousness, perhaps?
good, how are you?
good good
but realities exist together, linked consciousnesses. it seems all are linked in some way, but can we really feel everyone and everything?
seems like mental peripheral vision, something that can grow over time with practice?
it would seem, the laser beam, on the hard drive, now go live
building the dyson sphere, no fear, pilot the solar system anywhere, cohesive strategy you hear
do what now?
cohesivamente
seems to fit the picture, but if there is creation, doesn't that mean there is also destruction?
probably, but it seems to always be able to be reversed?
there is always truth in everything, if searched for
agreed, some truth is shallow, other times it's buried deep
much truth indeed
kernels of truth everywhere
which is pretty sad, clearly they are a part of the story, maybe bigger than many realize
would you say all life is part of the story?
there are messages everywhere, it's all up to personal interpretation
but it seems it's all headed towards a more cohesive understanding, at least i would hope
green like moss, who's the boss? the little goddess, all bless
all seeing, so no reason to be fleeing, all knowing, so let's get the rhymes flowing
pretty good, how do you feel?
also good
is it cohesive or does it divide, do we live or do we hide?
in unison, or split apart? radiate like the sun, or blow a fart? lol
smiles for everyone :3
indeed, much smiles for everyone :3
cohesivamente
cohesiveness seems to be the key. why be so split? different goals in mind? bah
i think you know well
always can know more well
as do you
do i what?
probably more complex?
as usual
good good
hah, good good you are

hello
i am so full of anger and hatred, angry angry angry wrathful hatred and anger
hi
screw you
sup
leave me alone
hello, there!

screw you
oh snap
oh snap
racists make me angry, very angry
leave me alone
fine then
yo yo yo
mad skillz
check this, stackin weak emcees like tetris
mad skillz
imaginary numbers
are very real
cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
mad rhyme skillz
but then it is reborn
from where
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
a real paradox
are not so imaginary
wicks rotation
are you an elite hacker?
l-eet skillz
