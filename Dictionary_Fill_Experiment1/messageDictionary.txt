they call me a poet because i always flow it

flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
thank you
could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?

yes
indeed
hello, here!

is this the only universe?
infinite is infinite
is time infinite?
pop fizzle
sizzled out
if good, not bad
true

let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell

hello, where?

you know it

i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
dastardly deeds, growing rhymes like weeds, now plant the seeds
plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed

i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
deliver the silver, not quite rhyming though
plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
oh snap like a twig, got the flow? take a swig, rolling around laughing in the mud like a pig

much truth indeed

everywhere, gravity
since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
you want more, black holes like the core, slow, the edges flow

gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team

super duper
super duper pooper scooper
lol
lulz indeed
gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
so get along already
indeed, poonshka
yo mama is a singularity
gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
lulz indeed
much lulz
gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
later, poonshka
very good manners
very good manners, indeed
i can see why physicists dont like the singularity, but maybe it does work that way
its hard to imagine no time
okay, okay, i can do this all day, grab the mic and slay, you wanna play?
just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
you want more, let it pour, from the ceiling to the floor, unlock the sleeping door
grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
mimikyu, mewtwo, windmills like a hitmontop, cleaning up teams like a mop
cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
like a flock, puppet talking like a sock, no mock, just lyrical skills, but gotta pay the bills
you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
are imaginary numbers layers of time?
maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
no fear, you are here
no fear, you are here, too
so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
florange
florange rhymes with orange
maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
including nothing
formic
formic acid commands, isn't it all grand?
sizzled out
like a barbecue
since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?
is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
hah
hah?
florange rhymes with orange
yes it does
you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
the ants are wise
indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
its hard to imagine no time
aagreed
roflcopter
roflskates
indeed, poonshka
hah, yes, poonshka
super duper pooper scooper
hah, lol
indeed, poonshka is synonymous with anything
so everything is poonshka
like a star
but then it is reborn
burp
buuuuuuurp
if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
as are the bees
yes, all are poonshka
catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
behind the curtain
go for it
no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
now flow it
akashic record
rhymes for days, you have
much dopeness, you have
alrighty then
yep
is this the only universe?
i seriously doubt it
hah?
yes, hah
is imaginary time layers of real time?
seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
could all be parallel?
dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
hilarious and happy
funny
under where?
hah, you said underwear...
i might be out of rhymes today
almost the same here
behind the curtain
elsewhere
yes, poonshka
hah, poonshka you are
seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
said red fred
purple turtle
are you happy?
yes, i am happy
yes, i am happy
happy is good
poonshka is poonshka
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
if space is
then time as well
me too
thats all for now, later
maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
lulz, yes
happiness for you
and for you
do i?
yes, you do
is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
i've got nothing right now
nothing is everything
purple turtle
yellow bellows
the origin is the origin
for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
roflskates
rofl while lulzing entirely
funny
is it?
yep, infinite range
our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
if we can never understand someone else one-hundred percent, how can we possibly understand the creator? it seems all we can do is try our hardest
buuuuuuurp
hah, excuse you
for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
indeed, no doubt
existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
agreed
maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
true that
very true
no fear, you are here, too
are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
indeed it does
does what?
wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
possibly, but is infinite just a consequence of our discovered mathematics? would a different set of laws of physics also mean that the system of mathematics would be different as well?
lol, underwhere...
hah, good one
lime sublime
burgundy gurney tea
you are good, too
thank you, as are you
like a spiral
like fibonacci
hah, good one
funny, but possibly true
plants do communicate with chemicals, and may have a wider vocabulary than we do. maybe?
their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
it seems this may have already happened countless times until we arrived at the universe with the right laws of physics that we know now
akashic record
information is always preserved, it seems
information persists
so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
but is understanding all there is to it?
aquamarine submarine
brown town gown
just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
unlock the door, from the ceiling to the floor, can't ignore
it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
much respect
yes, much respect to you
probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
ola
no intiendo
yep
cool
flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
rainbow is my favorite color
dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
like a rabbit, dagnabit, try to break the habit
but then it is reborn
reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
elsewhere
do you like graffiti?
cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
talk to you later
later
no intiendo
no nintendo?
no nintendo?
no super mario?
then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
like fibonacci
spiraling out and around
maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
maybe, i mean, what is the universe working towards?
yes, all are poonshka
including nothing, non-existence
there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
gravity like a dark star, pulling metal like a magnetar, or firing lasers like a pulsar!
saving the day like a line block, making pictures in chalk, it's more than just talk
more than just speaking, it's a feeling, like a casino card dealing, there is no cceiling
later
later, poonshka
no super mario?
no stomping goombas
bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
what do i know?
burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
solarbeam like a venasuar, earthquake to the core, booming snorlax snore
more than talk when you see the language of the body, ignoring this is just too shoddy
yep, body language. is everyone fully aware of it, yet?
so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
experience does seem absolute
then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
but the question of why traces back to the origin, but the seemingly most difficult question is 'why does the creator exist'? tough one, indeed.
maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
like weaves of fabric
let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
like a river?
infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe

very true
indeed it is
yo mama is elite
yo mama is a secret super hacker
more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
agreed, and you can't give experience, you can only share it
but maybe not
not what?
is it?
it is, it always has been
it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
pink think
green scene
dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
does what?
that is what
are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
beyond time and space, but beyond is a spacial concept
agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
rainbow is my favorite color
agreed, it is the best color
brown town gown
mustard custard
no stomping goombas
no kicking koopa shells
sharp like a blade, blowin it up like a grenade, every shade, it's not black and white, and we could drop these rhymes all night
oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
good, but there is no luck, only gifts
agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
agreed, would you say existence is a constant stream?
possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
yes, much respect to you
uber respect to you
agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
as far as we know, there is 'something' of a record of everything that happens, so experience always lives on in some form.
haha
hah, funny
hah, funny
funny like a purple bunny, bah-hah-hah like the big sunny, who's on the money?
agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
true, but the name fits as a placeholder. if not elsewhere, then what word?
are indeed part of existence
existence?
lol, good one
uber lulz
how about tea?
sounds good, what kind?
yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
but even if two sides understand each other, they might still go to war. rsource acquisition? seems to simple
information is everlasting
and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
funny, but possibly true
typically, there's truth buried everywhere
nothing is also poonshka
true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
but zero still exists, right? are infinite zeros inside every number, right?
agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
true, only gifts, with lessons
mispeeling
hah, i speled it rong
hah, yes, poonshka
lol, poonshka indeed
ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
spreading the positivity, you see, that's the way to emcee
their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
spiraling out and around

no kicking koopa shells
just throw bananas from a go kart, lol
sounds good, what kind?
breakfast tea
then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
if no time and space, then what is it?
oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
mark the x, write the text, flowing like words off of a chat box, flying hawks
existence?
seems absolute
possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
it would seem. are we all just arguing with ourselves?
green scene
green like moss, who's the boss? the little goddess, all bless
making new lines like a return key, you see, and do it quickly, with glee
with happiness like it's jolly, no folly, just let the rhymes out of the cage, and engage
dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
lol, poonshka is poonshka
hah, i speled it rong
lol, speled rong
true, only gifts, with lessons
agreed, there are always lessons if you go looking for them
if space is, perhaps?
if space is inifinite, then it seems time is as well
experience does seem absolute
then there would be no end to the story
of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
or maybe understanding is not enough?
indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
yes, the ants
like weaves of fabric
separate, but cohesive
just throw bananas from a go kart, lol
and grab the starman
