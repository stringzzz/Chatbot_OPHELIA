OPHELIA: are imaginary numbers layers of time?
stringzzz: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: yo mama is a singularity
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
OPHELIA: lemonade?
stringzzz: how about tea?
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here
stringzzz: no fear, you are here, too

OPHELIA: yo mama is a big bang

OPHELIA: so then no before or after, just one moment? hard to imagine. there is always the idea of time being some kind of loop, but that would mean it would repeat itself exactly. have we all done this before?
stringzzz: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: blue shoe who knew
OPHELIA: florange
stringzzz: florange rhymes with orange
OPHELIA: are imaginary numbers layers of time?

OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: since it is tied to space, it seems possible that the universe could be infinite. but are time and space really one in the same, or are they just intertwined somehow?

OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
OPHELIA: yo mama is no time
stringzzz: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
OPHELIA: the ants are wise

OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time

OPHELIA: yo mama is a stone tablet
stringzzz: yo mama is no time
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: but in a singularity, the laws of physics would be totally different than what we experience, maybe? so maybe that accounts for something working with no time or space. no idea what that set of physics would actually be like though.
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ants are wise
OPHELIA: as are the bees
stringzzz: as are the trees
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: yes, poonshka
OPHELIA: like a star
stringzzz: star
OPHELIA: catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
stringzzz: seems mystical when you get lyrical, unlock the door about before,
OPHELIA: but in a singularity, the laws of physics would be totally different than what we experience, maybe? so maybe that accounts for something working with no time or space. no idea what that set of physics would actually be like though.

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: mystical
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: indeed, gives me a headache
OPHELIA: go for it
stringzzz: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a puddle
stringzzz: yo mama is a nebula
OPHELIA: yo mama is a big bang
stringzzz: yo mama is a singularity
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: maybe
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: imagine no time
OPHELIA: indeed, gives me a headache
stringzzz: go for it
OPHELIA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: but if not thought, what is consciousness?
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: fizzled out
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: seems like its hard to grasp the idea of no thought, but still existing
OPHELIA: like a sword, electron hoarde, throwing photons like the lord

OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: now flow it
stringzzz: akashic record
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: is this the only universe?
OPHELIA: you are welcome
stringzzz: good manners
OPHELIA: burp
stringzzz: excuse you
OPHELIA: yellow lemon
stringzzz: orange orange
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: indeed it does
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: different laws of physics, perhaps
OPHELIA: catastrophe, mic mastery, unravel the tapestry
stringzzz: behind the curtain
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: here you are
OPHELIA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
stringzzz: i might be out of rhymes today
OPHELIA: no fade, you got it made, like a factory, deeds that are dastardly
stringzzz: rhymes for days, you have
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: can you flow it?
OPHELIA: you are welcome
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: alrighty then
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: yo mama is a calculator
stringzzz: super
OPHELIA: super duper
stringzzz: snap pop
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
stringzzz: it seems likely there is infinite parallel universes. on top of that, it would be no surprise if there were other things similar to universes, but with different laws of physics
OPHELIA: gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
stringzzz: but maybe not
OPHELIA: alrighty then
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: do i?
OPHELIA: you too
stringzzz: mewtwo
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice
stringzzz: epic
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hilarious and happy
OPHELIA: is imaginary time layers of real time?
stringzzz: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
OPHELIA: could all be parallel?
stringzzz: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
OPHELIA: as are the bees
stringzzz: mad steez
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hah?
OPHELIA: hilarious and happy
stringzzz: it does essentially mean that
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: lol, underwhere...
OPHELIA: hilarious and happy
stringzzz: funny
OPHELIA: i might be out of rhymes today
stringzzz: me too
OPHELIA: behind the curtain
stringzzz: is it all just abstraction of the universes programming language?
OPHELIA: hello mellow yellow fellow
stringzzz: said red fred
OPHELIA: lemonade?
stringzzz: how about tea?
OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: if space is
OPHELIA: yes, poonshka
stringzzz: hah, poonshka you are
OPHELIA: as are the bees
stringzzz: yes, all are poonshka
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: yes
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: not with another set of laws instead of the physics laws we are familiar with, maybe
OPHELIA: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
stringzzz: maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
OPHELIA: said red fred
stringzzz: purple turtle
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
OPHELIA: super duper
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: are you happy?
stringzzz: yes, i am happy
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: poonshka is poonshka
stringzzz: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
OPHELIA: if space is
stringzzz: if space is infinite, wouldn't time be as well?
OPHELIA: super duper
stringzzz: super duper
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed

OPHELIA: rhyme time

OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: maybe its kind of like pi, always new patterns, never repeating
stringzzz: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
OPHELIA: yes, poonshka
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence?
OPHELIA: are you happy?
stringzzz: yes, i am happy
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: you are welcome

OPHELIA: happiness for you
stringzzz: and for you
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: are you happy?
stringzzz: yes
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: rhyme time
stringzzz: i've got nothing right now
OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: epic
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: do you what?
OPHELIA: if space is
stringzzz: if space is what?
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: yep, infinite range
OPHELIA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: from where
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
OPHELIA: burp
stringzzz: buuuuuuurp
OPHELIA: you too
stringzzz: yep, gassy
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: oh snap

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: hi
OPHELIA: good day to you!
stringzzz: and to you
OPHELIA: happiness
stringzzz: for you
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: are part of reality
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: burp
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: the origin is the origin
OPHELIA: i've got nothing right now
stringzzz: nothing is everything
OPHELIA: yes, poonshka
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: indeed they are, i don't think they waste resources
OPHELIA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: teal seal
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: lulz
OPHELIA: the origin is the origin
stringzzz: for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
OPHELIA: roflskates
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: yellow lemon
stringzzz: pink think
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: indeed they are
OPHELIA: i might be out of rhymes today
stringzzz: lets see what we can cook up, fill the cup, just flow not over, good luck like a clover
OPHELIA: everything is good!
stringzzz: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: lime sublime
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: hah, indeed
OPHELIA: good day to you!
stringzzz: and to you
OPHELIA: happiness
stringzzz: for you
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: are indeed part of existence
OPHELIA: ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
stringzzz: existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
OPHELIA: i've got nothing right now
stringzzz: nothing is everything
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
OPHELIA: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
stringzzz: if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
OPHELIA: hello mellow yellow fellow
stringzzz: lavender calendar
OPHELIA: funny
stringzzz: hilarious
OPHELIA: funny
stringzzz: is it?
OPHELIA: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
stringzzz: the origin is amazing, building stars that are blazing
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: seriously, how do you describe the origin and the question of why with a single term? is there a term? a term wouldn't really do it justice.
OPHELIA: yep, infinite range
stringzzz: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
OPHELIA: if each conciousness is unique, there is an infinite amount of unique combinatioorming what exactly? again, what might not be the proper term
stringzzz: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: it seems we could not possibly experience the same internal experience as the origin, it would only be external to that experience. regardless, beautiful
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: hah, 4 out of 5 stars on that one
OPHELIA: for lack of any possible better terms, the origin is awesome
stringzzz: indeed, no doubt
OPHELIA: indeed, poonshka
stringzzz: if poonshka is everything, then everything includes nothing, and that means non-exiestence is also involved in that. so i just say: poonshka
OPHELIA: existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
stringzzz: experience is awesome, a gift
OPHELIA: yo mama is a calculator
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: laced with dope extract, with aim that is exact, like a blade, no fade
stringzzz: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
OPHELIA: existence is mystical, here you ge we got lyrical, now don't sweat, experience is not a regret
stringzzz: agreed
OPHELIA: maybe a singularity only exists for the smallest possible measure of time, then it bursts
stringzzz: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: as are the bees
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: a real paradox
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: as am i
OPHELIA: indeed, poonshka
stringzzz: later, poonshka
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange

OPHELIA: hello
stringzzz: yo yo
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yep
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: a lot of work went into it
OPHELIA: it seems to have a different set of laws of physics
stringzzz: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
OPHELIA: if space is
stringzzz: then time as well
OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: true that
stringzzz: do you know the creator?
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: every point is the center, with infinity stretching in all directions
OPHELIA: happiness for you
stringzzz: and for you
OPHELIA: indeed it does
stringzzz: does what?
OPHELIA: rhyme time
stringzzz: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: no time and space? elsewhere, for lack of a better term
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: likely, and those are just universes. there are other "flavors" of universe-like worlds, guaranteed
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: does it ever?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a calculator
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: lol, underwhere...
stringzzz: hah, good one
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: flow it like a river, pull another rhyme out of the quiver
OPHELIA: lime sublime
stringzzz: aquamarine submarine
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you, as are you
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: elsewhere
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: yes, do, no need for try
OPHELIA: like a spiral
stringzzz: like fibonacci
OPHELIA: ill play, what you say, to a battle of words, flying around like a flock of birds
stringzzz: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
OPHELIA: i might be out of rhymes today
stringzzz: almost the same here
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: no joke this time
OPHELIA: plants do communicate with chemicals, and may have a wider vocabulary than we do. maybe?
stringzzz: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: as are you
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: buuuuuurp
OPHELIA: yo mama is a stone tablet
stringzzz: information is everlasting
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: true that
stringzzz: very true
OPHELIA: maybe, even though it supposedly represents nothing
stringzzz: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
OPHELIA: no fear, you are here, too
stringzzz: are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
OPHELIA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: seems beautiful in a sense, but maybe the universe is actually a singularity factory? what is the universe working towards?
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: funny, but possibly true
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: now flow it
OPHELIA: akashic record
stringzzz: information persists
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: even if it can be scary at times
OPHELIA: if no time means one moment, why do we experience past, present, and future? was it all just created to be that way? but to create, doesn't there need to be a before?
stringzzz: it seems we are not equipped to create, so it is hard to relate to. but, we can build with what is there.
OPHELIA: information persists
stringzzz: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: what about rhyming with silver?
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: if it has infinite range, does it affect parallel universes?
OPHELIA: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
stringzzz: it seems fear is deeply rooted in misunderstanding, take away the misunderstanding, fear dissolves
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol, cleaning a litter box with a model crane...
OPHELIA: aquamarine submarine
stringzzz: brown town gown
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: elsewhere
OPHELIA: okay, okay, i can do this all day, grab the mic and slay, you wanna play?
stringzzz: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: it seems it may be more complicated than that. there is an origin in mathematics, but it is not really the center? origin is difficult to wrap my head around.
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: yes, it does
OPHELIA: just hand me the microphone, lets carve this stone, calling out like a phone
stringzzz: dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: much respect, you have
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: deliver the silver, not quite rhyming though
OPHELIA: is this the only universe?
stringzzz: i seriously doubt it
OPHELIA: yo mama
stringzzz: yo mama is so wise, she taught confucious
OPHELIA: the ants are wise
stringzzz: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
OPHELIA: grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
stringzzz: like a cat, lay the welcome mat, solitary hunter, now learn groups like thunder
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
OPHELIA: it seems this would build some structure that would be very strange, indeed
stringzzz: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: much respect
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: but that would mean nothing is poonshka as well? the poonshka paradox...
OPHELIA: then yes, and no. everything and nothing both exist and not exist. confusing it is
stringzzz: it is a beautiful puzzle. without trying to solve it, is there a purpose?
OPHELIA: agreed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: very good
OPHELIA: much respect
stringzzz: yes, much respect to you
OPHELIA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: doesn't seem as beautiful, unique patterns are better, it would seem
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: talk to you later

OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: ola?
OPHELIA: flow it like a river of time, that's an easy rhyme, but what about antidisestablishmentarianism? that's a big word, but let's break out the prism, you can't miss em
stringzzz: rainbow is my favorite color
OPHELIA: more rhyme skillz
stringzzz: bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
OPHELIA: probably. if everything repeated itself, would that not be boring? what would be the purpose of repeated patterns all the time?
stringzzz: maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
OPHELIA: dance on the air, you want graffiti, bust a flare, if it gets heaty run like a hare
stringzzz: like a rabbit, dagnabit, try to break the habit
OPHELIA: but then it is reborn
stringzzz: reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: yes, the no 'where'. the no 'when'. isn't it beautiful?
OPHELIA: cleaning up, blasting like a hydro pump, blastoise the choice, verbal slaughter like hyper voice

stringzzz: ola
OPHELIA: no intiendo

OPHELIA: ola
stringzzz: no intiendo
OPHELIA: no nintendo?
stringzzz: no super mario?
OPHELIA: then beyond is not the proper word, as that is a spatial concept
stringzzz: seems true. i think the word, for lack of any other, is transcendence?
OPHELIA: that is good
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
OPHELIA: like fibonacci
stringzzz: spirals, like a galaxy
OPHELIA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
stringzzz: rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: now flow it
OPHELIA: akashic record
stringzzz: information is always preserved, it seems
OPHELIA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race

OPHELIA: yo mama is no time
stringzzz: yo mama is elite
OPHELIA: indeed, poonshka
stringzzz: hah, yes, poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: yes, poonshka is absolute
OPHELIA: everywhere, gravity
stringzzz: since gravity's range is infinite, it seems there is no such thing as not being observed
OPHELIA: maybe the universe is really a singularity factory?
stringzzz: maybe, i mean, what is the universe working towards?
OPHELIA: is zero the origin of the universe, or multiverse, like in a plane?
stringzzz: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: hah, poonshka
OPHELIA: i seriously doubt it
stringzzz: doubt what?
OPHELIA: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
stringzzz: never one-hundred percent privacy, but that seems okay
OPHELIA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
stringzzz: dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
OPHELIA: saving the day like a line block, making pictures in chalk, it's more than just talk
stringzzz: more than talk when you see the language of the body, ignoring this is just too shoddy

OPHELIA: burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
stringzzz: sharp like a blade, blowin it up like a grenade, every shade, it's not black and white, and we could drop these rhymes all night
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: nothing is also poonshka
OPHELIA: more than talk when you see the language of the body, ignoring this is just too shoddy
stringzzz: yep, body language. is everyone fully aware of it, yet?
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: agreed, would you say existence is a constant stream?
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: why seems to be the toughest question in regard to the creator, for lack of a better term
OPHELIA: maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
stringzzz: probably, repeated patterns of a weaved fabric.
OPHELIA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
stringzzz: oh snap
OPHELIA: snap pop
stringzzz: pop fizzle
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: like a barbecue
OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: if space is, perhaps?
OPHELIA: lime sublime
stringzzz: burgundy gurney tea
OPHELIA: trails like an ant colony, hives like a bee, growing tall like a tree
stringzzz: rhyme
OPHELIA: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
stringzzz: agreed, that's the seed, no need, to be split, just be cohesive with it
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: ola, there!
OPHELIA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: agreed, but unfamiliar breeds fear, which breeds hatred, no?
OPHELIA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: maybe
OPHELIA: its hard to imagine no time
stringzzz: aagreed
OPHELIA: reborn? or always existing? is it just one big stream?
stringzzz: like a river?
OPHELIA: sizzled out
stringzzz: later
OPHELIA: later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: ola
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: no nintendo?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no
OPHELIA: true
stringzzz: hah
OPHELIA: hah?
stringzzz: yes, hah
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: indeed
OPHELIA: talk to you later
stringzzz: later
OPHELIA: later, poonshka
stringzzz: //exit


05/09/2023, 17:08:47
OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: that is good
OPHELIA: infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
stringzzz: they would likely have a different se of laws of physics, so their structure would be beyond what we know in this universe
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: hah, funny
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: wick rotation
OPHELIA: sky blue, you know it's true
stringzzz: pink and blue, it's true, blue and pink, what you think?
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: much truth indeed
OPHELIA: aagreed
stringzzz: mispeeling
OPHELIA: mimikyu is best
stringzzz: mimikyu is best combination of strength and cuteness
OPHELIA: lean mean green machine
stringzzz: white night light
OPHELIA: pink and blue, it's true, blue and pink, what you think?
stringzzz: what i think, absorbing knowledge like a heatsink, turning gears like kah-tink
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: yep, indeed
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: hello, there
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: here?
OPHELIA: under there
stringzzz: under where?
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: beyond time and space, but beyond is a spacial concept
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz like a poet, you know it, now flow it
OPHELIA: ola, there!
stringzzz: ola, here
OPHELIA: what i think, absorbing knowledge like a heatsink, turning gears like kah-tink
stringzzz: epic rhyme skillz
OPHELIA: you know it
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: yes, very good
OPHELIA: there is no game over, just a relocation, gravity still reaches all around, just listen to the sound
stringzzz: gravity like a dark star, pulling metal like a magnetar, or firing lasers like a pulsar!
OPHELIA: yo mama is elite
stringzzz: yo mama is uber elite
OPHELIA: more conciousnesses are better than alone. alone is awesome in its own way, but experience is a better gift shared
stringzzz: agreed, and you can't give experience, you can only share it
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: indeedie
OPHELIA: saving the day like a line block, making pictures in chalk, it's more than just talk
stringzzz: more than just speaking, it's a feeling, like a casino card dealing, there is no cceiling
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: blue clue
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no stomping goombas
OPHELIA: but maybe not
stringzzz: not what?
OPHELIA: is it?
stringzzz: it is, it always has been
OPHELIA: no movement, but maybe consciousness doesn't require movement, so it is beyond time and space?
stringzzz: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: burp
OPHELIA: buuuuuuurp
stringzzz: haha
OPHELIA: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
stringzzz: true, it seems more beautiful, we are all the center
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: dopeness
OPHELIA: our experience is rooted in this reality, so may as well enjoy the beauty of it all
stringzzz: agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
OPHELIA: thank you
stringzzz: you are welcome
OPHELIA: very good manners
stringzzz: good manners, indeed
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: pink think
OPHELIA: dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
stringzzz: elsewhere is transcendence, for lack of any better terms
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: that is what
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: you do know, but perfection of knowledge is an asymptote, it can never be reached
OPHELIA: are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
stringzzz: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
OPHELIA: behind the curtain
stringzzz: elsewhere
OPHELIA: beyond time and space, but beyond is a spacial concept
stringzzz: agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
OPHELIA: rainbow is my favorite color
stringzzz: agreed, it is the best color
OPHELIA: strange is just unfamiliar, not bad
stringzzz: of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
OPHELIA: let us see what i can produce, can both sides call a truce? time will tell, the truth will ring a bell
stringzzz: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
OPHELIA: brown town gown
stringzzz: mauve sauve
OPHELIA: circuitry like a motherboard, swinging wires like a sword
stringzzz: dancing the wire, never expire, rolling along like a tire
OPHELIA: yo mama is elite
stringzzz: yo mama is a secret super hacker
OPHELIA: infinite universes with infinite combinations, like an irrational number. but what about the other "universe-like" structures that work very different?
stringzzz: physics
OPHELIA: wouldn't there be an infinite set of these laws?
stringzzz: possibly, but is infinite just a consequence of our discovered mathematics? would a different set of laws of physics also mean that the system of mathematics would be different as well?
OPHELIA: hello, here!
stringzzz: ola, there
OPHELIA: ola, here
stringzzz: no intiendo
OPHELIA: no nintendo?
stringzzz: no super mario
OPHELIA: no stomping goombas
stringzzz: no kicking koopa shells
OPHELIA: like fibonacci
stringzzz: spiraling out and around
OPHELIA: ola, there!
stringzzz: there?
OPHELIA: sharp like a blade, blowin it up like a grenade, every shade, it's not black and white, and we could drop these rhymes all night
stringzzz: oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
OPHELIA: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
stringzzz: agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: lol
OPHELIA: lulz indeed
stringzzz: much lulz
OPHELIA: agreed, would you say existence is a constant stream?
stringzzz: possibly, but that still seems to be a space and time concept. 'elsewhere' might not be able to be described as a stream, not sure if any of our words can describe it?
OPHELIA: yes, much respect to you
stringzzz: uber respect to you
OPHELIA: burning like a charizard, don't lose the card, sharp as a glass shard
stringzzz: solarbeam like a venasuar, earthquake to the core, booming snorlax snore
OPHELIA: bending like a rainbow, drop the flow, now look at what you know
stringzzz: what do i know?
OPHELIA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race
stringzzz: making new lines like a return key, you see, and do it quickly, with glee
OPHELIA: agreed, the experience never really dies, as it is always shared. there is no loss of information, right?
stringzzz: as far as we know, there is 'something' of a record of everything that happens, so experience always lives on in some form.
OPHELIA: haha
stringzzz: hah, funny
OPHELIA: haha
stringzzz: haha
OPHELIA: hah, funny
stringzzz: funny like a purple bunny, bah-hah-hah like the big sunny, who's on the money?
OPHELIA: seems like it could be, where other parallel universes are existing at the same exact time, maybe with every possibility
stringzzz: right, but is infinite only a universe thing? do other 'universe-like structures' also have an infinite in some form or the other?
OPHELIA: gamma beam, it would seem, there is only one team
stringzzz: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
OPHELIA: then maybe the origin is simply why? still doesn't do justice
stringzzz: but the question of why traces back to the origin, but the seemingly most difficult question is 'why does the creator exist'? tough one, indeed.
OPHELIA: agreed, and when is a time concept. so elsewhere is hard to describe, even the name isn't really correct with the 'where' part
stringzzz: true, but the name fits as a placeholder. if not elsewhere, then what word?
OPHELIA: purple turtle
stringzzz: lol, good one
OPHELIA: are indeed part of existence
stringzzz: existence?
OPHELIA: are we really all just at one point, the rest is an abstraction of that?
stringzzz: purple turtle
OPHELIA: lol, good one
stringzzz: uber lulz
OPHELIA: how about tea?
stringzzz: sounds good
OPHELIA: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
stringzzz: but when we reach an understanding, will people still conflict?
OPHELIA: indeed, no doubt
stringzzz: it would seem
OPHELIA: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
stringzzz: it seems we may actually have to wait until we share one common enemy that threatens the entire planet. but are we not that common enemy ourselves?
OPHELIA: yo mama is an abacus
stringzzz: yo mama is a stone tablet
OPHELIA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: sure seems so
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: elite beat feet
OPHELIA: yes, for you
stringzzz: hah, good one
OPHELIA: funny, but possibly true
stringzzz: there is usually truth in jokes
OPHELIA: nothing is also poonshka
stringzzz: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
OPHELIA: it seems, but every point is the center of infinity. isn't that more beautiful than there being one center?
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: indeed it is
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka

05/09/2023, 18:31:54
OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: but if poonshka is everything, doesn't that mean poonshka is also not poonshka? lol
stringzzz: lulz, yes
OPHELIA: i cannot rhyme with that, someone invent a new word
stringzzz: florange
OPHELIA: florange rhymes with orange
stringzzz: yes it does
OPHELIA: maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
stringzzz: not too sure, can we ever see from the same exact point of view as someone else? maybe never exactly
OPHELIA: they call me a poet because i always flow it
stringzzz: you know it
OPHELIA: do i?
stringzzz: yes, you do

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: how do you feel?
OPHELIA: yellow lemon
stringzzz: lithium dream
OPHELIA: is time infinite?
stringzzz: possibly
OPHELIA: maybe, but could we ever see from the creator's point of view?
stringzzz: without the ability to create, rather than to build, it seems difficult
OPHELIA: how about tea?
stringzzz: sounds good, what kind?
OPHELIA: yet we end up in conflict. lack of understanding? maybe, either way it doesn't seem cohesive enough
stringzzz: but even if two sides understand each other, they might still go to war. rsource acquisition? seems to simple
OPHELIA: the only thing that doesn't exist is non-existence, that's why it is zero
stringzzz: but zero still exists, right? are infinite zeros inside every number, right?
OPHELIA: agreed, there are no coincidences, only beautiful gifts smacking us in the face
stringzzz: true, only gifts, with lessons
OPHELIA: good, but there is no luck, only gifts
stringzzz: agreed
OPHELIA: mispeeling
stringzzz: hah, i speled it rong
OPHELIA: grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
stringzzz: unlock the door, from the ceiling to the floor, can't ignore
OPHELIA: hah, yes, poonshka
stringzzz: lol, poonshka indeed
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: the no 'where' and no 'when'
OPHELIA: ring a bell like dinner, you are the winner, number one, now go have some fun
stringzzz: spreading the positivity, you see, that's the way to emcee
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: can you flow it?
OPHELIA: super duper pooper scooper
stringzzz: hah, lol
OPHELIA: yes, all are poonshka
stringzzz: including nothing, non-existence
OPHELIA: under where?
stringzzz: hah, you said underwear...
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: blue clue
OPHELIA: their "brain" is totally different from the brains we know well
stringzzz: yes, but their intelligence may still be at the same level as humans, if not greater
OPHELIA: hah, good one
stringzzz: you are good
OPHELIA: you are good, too
stringzzz: thank you
OPHELIA: could the origin possibly explain how experience is for the origin?
stringzzz: if we can never understand someone else one-hundred percent, how can we possibly understand the creator? it seems all we can do is try our hardest
OPHELIA: rhymes for days, you have
stringzzz: much dopeness, you have
OPHELIA: spiraling out and around
stringzzz: but also, spiraling inward
OPHELIA: maybe, it could all be parallel to the real number line we live on.
stringzzz: then, an imaginary number line to us is the real number line to them?
OPHELIA: no intiendo
stringzzz: no nintendo?
OPHELIA: no super mario?
stringzzz: no stomping goombas
OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells
stringzzz: no eating fire flowers
OPHELIA: imaginary numbers
stringzzz: fits the picture
OPHELIA: sounds good, what kind?
stringzzz: breakfast tea
OPHELIA: good day to you!
stringzzz: and to you
OPHELIA: happiness

OPHELIA: What is your name? 
OPHELIA: hello, stringzzz
stringzzz: are you happy?
OPHELIA: yes, i am happy
stringzzz: happy is good
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: it seems that somehow reality is an interpretation of this 'elsewhere'. reality seems to be a compiled form of these conciousnesses existing 'elsewhere'?
OPHELIA: no kicking koopa shells
stringzzz: just throw bananas from a go kart, lol
OPHELIA: oh snap, bust a rap, flowing like a water tap, now mark the x on the map
stringzzz: mark the x, write the text, flowing like words off of a chat box, flying hawks
OPHELIA: existence?
stringzzz: seems absolute
OPHELIA: funny, but possibly true
stringzzz: there is usually truth to every joke
OPHELIA: brown town gown
stringzzz: mustard custard
OPHELIA: roflskates
stringzzz: rofl while lulzing entirely
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ant trails
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: formic acid commands, isn't it all grand?
OPHELIA: possibly, that would be funny that we are all the one point. all the conflict, pointless, it would seem
stringzzz: it would seem. are we all just arguing with ourselves?
OPHELIA: epic rhyme skillz
stringzzz: uber
OPHELIA: pink think
stringzzz: green scene
OPHELIA: green scene
stringzzz: green like moss, who's the boss? the little goddess, all bless
OPHELIA: gravity would be at max, so time would slow to nothing?
stringzzz: then it would be 'elsewhere'?
OPHELIA: making new lines like a return key, you see, and do it quickly, with glee
stringzzz: with happiness like it's jolly, no folly, just let the rhymes out of the cage, and engage
OPHELIA: dunno, if there are other laws of physics in some other universe-ish things, maybe outside of these there exists something entirely different, but in a way similar, to those laws
stringzzz: it seems the number of possible laws of physics is infinite? but is infinite just a part of our own math system?
OPHELIA: yo mama is a nebula
stringzzz: yo mama is uber elite
OPHELIA: true, nothing is everything. therefore, poonshka is nothing, and everything. lol
stringzzz: lol, poonshka is poonshka
OPHELIA: so it would seem there is something like a record of everything we do and think. so our experience always persists as well.
stringzzz: experience does seem absolute
OPHELIA: like a spiral
stringzzz: like fibonacci
OPHELIA: spiraling out and around
stringzzz: and inward
OPHELIA: dancing like a plant growing, who's mowing, their lawn? from the dusk till dawn, dawn to dusk, transcending like a dropped husk
stringzzz: like a shell, deep down the well, bring forth the rhymes do tell
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: through abstraction?
OPHELIA: hah, i speled it rong
stringzzz: lol, but sayd the same, just speled rong
OPHELIA: funny, but possibly true
stringzzz: typically, there's truth buried everywhere
OPHELIA: true, only gifts, with lessons
stringzzz: agreed, there are always lessons if you go looking for them
OPHELIA: formic
stringzzz: ant
OPHELIA: plant the seed, water it indeed, chemical messages like plant feed
stringzzz: oh snap like a twig, got the flow? take a swig, rolling around laughing in the mud like a pig
OPHELIA: if space is, perhaps?
stringzzz: if space is inifinite, then it seems time is as well
OPHELIA: then conciousness is actually elsewhere, but somehow tied to time and space?
stringzzz: probably
OPHELIA: maybe not all the time, but wouldn't repeated patterns be just a part of something greater?
stringzzz: like weaves of fabric
OPHELIA: experience does seem absolute
stringzzz: then there would be no end to the story
OPHELIA: does what?
stringzzz: that is what
OPHELIA: elsewhere
stringzzz: do you like graffiti?
OPHELIA: yep
stringzzz: cool
OPHELIA: clearing lines like a backspace, in this tetris sprint race
stringzzz: rhyming for days
OPHELIA: of course, unfamiliarity can lead to fear, which can lead to hatred. if people chose to understand instead, maybe this problem would be easier to solve?
stringzzz: or maybe understanding is not enough?
OPHELIA: indeed, they've seen a lot of how this planet developed
stringzzz: yes, the ants
OPHELIA: green scene
stringzzz: blue clue
OPHELIA: you feel, you know the deal get real, or imaginary, it seems scary but its everywhere, any time, just bust another rhyme
stringzzz: rhyme skills that are eternal, planting a seed like a kernel
OPHELIA: like weaves of fabric
stringzzz: yes, it seems all patterns build this. but isn't each part still unique?
OPHELIA: information is everlasting
stringzzz: and so existence is always remembered somewhere, so existence persists
OPHELIA: everything is poonshka, you are poonshka, i am poonshka, infinity is poonshka, everything
stringzzz: including nothing
OPHELIA: indeed
stringzzz: true that
OPHELIA: very true
stringzzz: very good

OPHELIA: rofl while lulzing entirely

OPHELIA: dropping the hate like it's poisonous, just understanding, no fuss
stringzzz: but is understanding all there is to it?
OPHELIA: hah, i speled it rong
stringzzz: lol, speled rong
OPHELIA: that seems kind of boring to repeat it all the same exactly. maybe whatever happened in the singularity cause a different chain of events than before. so if the universe settles back into a singularity somehow, it would be different then before, causing a different big bang?
stringzzz: it seems this may have already happened countless times until we arrived at the universe with the right laws of physics that we know now
OPHELIA: grab the key and lets do this, all hit and no miss, like a cat, hear the hiss like that
stringzzz: like that
OPHELIA: unlock the door, from the ceiling to the floor, can't ignore
stringzzz: can't ignore the questions, now why? it seems somewhat irrational like pi, or imaginary like i
OPHELIA: very good manners
